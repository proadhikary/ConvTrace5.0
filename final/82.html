Asking children and teens about potential traumas they may have experienced can be challenging, particularly for clinicians who don't have a focus in mental health. 2. Dr. Lawson interviewed Sam on his own to ask him the same screening questions and confirm his score. She had an ACE score of 3 based on what his mother was reporting. 4. Clinicians can visit the online trauma toolkit website for a list of resources on these evidence-based interventions which have been shown to be helpful for children like Sam and their families.</div>
