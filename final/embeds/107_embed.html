                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How are you doing today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know when you spoke last time, you had some goals that you want to talk about this time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you ready to do that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I need to, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What do you have in mind?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just keep thinking about losing this weight and I just, I really want to do it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just can't get there and I don't know why.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're frustrated.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's so ridiculous.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Frustrated trying to lose the weight.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Now you had said before that you had a specific number of pounds in mind, specific amount of weight to lose.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you still have that in mind?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I would like 20 pounds.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>20 pounds.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I would like more, but I've tried to do more in the past and I don't even get past a couple of days.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So if I can do 20, that would be great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What have you tried before and what do you think got in the way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it wasn't convenient.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I want to do it and it means a lot for me and my family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'd be a lot healthier.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's important to you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But just like something always gets in the way, you know, and then I lose focus.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not very good at staying focused on stuff like that anyway.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So loss of focus.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you start trying to lose the weight and your focus gets disrupted.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I forget and then I make, you know, spaghetti casserole for six people and then I eat a lot of it and that's carbs and cheese and fat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And then I, you know, we'll eat what my kids don't eat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And then it's just like, I forget that I'm supposed to be making healthy choices.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you know how to lose weight and you know you can lose weight, but your focus is a little off when you're trying and that's causing the problem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Could we break that goal of losing 20 pounds down into smaller units like say five pounds?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Do you think, well maybe.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, cause I've never, I always just keep like the chunk of weight, you know, ahead of me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't break it into smaller income.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's not my work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I don't know how I'd have to stay on top of it though.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Weigh myself every day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that something you can do?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm so busy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Or once a week.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I probably do once a week.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Put a sticky note somewhere or something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, maybe.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I want to try.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm going to say yes cause I want to try it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you mentioned the loss of focus is one problem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about motivation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel motivated to move through all those steps like five pounds and five pounds and so on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I would need something to keep me going, you know, week to week.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>A little bit of something extra to help you stay motivated.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes when your kid does their homework early and you can give them a special treat for dessert, that helps keep it going.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So some sort of activity or item that you enjoy that you could reserve for when you reach that goal of say the first five pounds.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I would love, I mean, I'm just, I've been so embarrassed, you know, lately.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I feel like I just, if I can find something that keeps me motivated, that would be great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you have a activity or item in mind that we could put in place as something you could reward yourself with?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like after the first five pounds?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, there's a few ways we could do it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We could do that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you reach five pounds and then you can give yourself that reward.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Or it could be for something you do every day if that day you're successful in eating the way you want to eat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What do you think would motivate you more?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe something every day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I remember, you know, I just get so distracted by other stuff.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There was something every day that maybe I put out almost like a goal at the end of the day or something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, if I made the right choices.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, so you know each and every day as you're trying to lose weight, you're aware when that day comes to a close if you had a successful day or a less than successful day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>If you had a successful day, then you could engage in an activity or receive an item that we work out in advance that you know would motivate you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And that could be, you know, maybe watching like a favorite TV show.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, because I don't watch TV at night because I'm so busy, you know, cleaning up and everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe I could just take some time for myself because I did something good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, and just watch a TV show.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So let's do that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>On a day, you know, toward the evening when you know you have had a successful day, by what time would you know in the evening?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Probably as I'm preparing dinner.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>If I prepare a good dinner or if I prepare fun food for my kids but I don't eat it, like chicken nuggets and french fries and stuff, I would know, you know, maybe by like six or seven.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Let's say seven.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So by seven p.m.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>at that point, in terms of the day being successful or less than successful, you know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>By seven p.m.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>you're aware.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And at that point, if you have met your goal, then you have a TV show that you maybe have recorded on the TV or something you would watch.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And if you were not as successful, you would.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it'd be like something to keep you motivated throughout the day because you really want to watch that show.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It'd be a lot of fun.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You think that structure, that kind of behavioral strategy would give you enough motivation to have successful days through this process?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not a fan of it, honestly, but it would probably beat the way I feel right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Anything's kind of better than carrying this, this frustration around.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I'm willing to try anything and I'll try to remember.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I said, I'll write it down, you know, have it in the kitchen, have it on a note at seven p.m.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, how did I do today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, this is something you could also track, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You could write down days that were successful, days that were less than successful, and we could look at if there's any patterns.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maybe weekends are harder, weekends are easier, you know, or something where we can identify days that have maybe more triggers or where you're less motivated.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I didn't think about that because, right, every day would be different.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There's a potential for every day to be different with what you're exposed to and what temptations in terms of different foods or what your schedule is like.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maybe if you're busier, it's easier.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So we can look at those different patterns and we can add levels to this plan.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But for now, we'll go with the TV show that you'll watch sometime after seven.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So at seven, you'll evaluate how you did, and then sometime after that, watch the show.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's like a plan?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So that's leading up to the five pounds.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's just day by day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Take this in five pound increments four times to get to your goal of 20 pounds.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does that sound good?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So far so good, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We'll give that a shot and we'll take a look at the pattern that emerges.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So record everything, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So write everything down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you'll see around seven is a good time when you know what kind of day you had.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Write down kind of what happened that day and whether you had success or not and bring that in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'll see you again in a week.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that'll give you seven days to work with.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And we'll look at that log of events and we'll reevaluate each week.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I could start tonight?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Start tonight.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So we'll give that a shot and I'll see you in a week.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thanks.</div>
