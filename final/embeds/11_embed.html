                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>One is that you're saying you're all the same.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You are all the same.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Nothing is working.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You're all the same.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm feeling just lumped in with everybody else right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, you are because you're all the same.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Of course, you're lumped in with everybody.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not going to single you out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not going to make you single you out because you're all not doing anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You don't do anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There's all this abstract metaphysical stuff and there's no concrete, this is the way to fix it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>This is the goal.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There's nothing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So what's the point?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I mean, is there something specific right now that I could say or do that would give you what you're wanting or needing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>How do I go from point A to point B?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>How do I get better?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>How do I fix what's going on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, that's the reason I came here, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I thought that was the reason I came here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It was to fix things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Make things better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you want a step-by-step description of how?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I need something to grab onto.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You need something to hold onto?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I need something to grab onto.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>See, my sense is that you sort of desperately want something to grab onto to give you some sense of hope.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I really want to be able to give you something, but it feels like there's something about the kind of intensity of your sort of demand or plea right now, which makes it difficult for me to really sort of respond in a way that's going to give you what you need.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Or a better way of putting it is I have a sense that the kind of thing that you want or you're needing has to kind of come out of an organic process between the two of us.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And there's something about the sort of intensity of your desperation, which makes it difficult for you to really be open and receptive to whatever I have to give.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's just the way I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I always come out like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I always ... It's the way I get things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's the only way I get things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's the only way I know how to be.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I come out one of two ways.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I come out either full throttle, just full tilt.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Just come at them and just do it that way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Or I don't do anything at all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So it's like I'm one way and it's not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I'm the other way and it's not good enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it's like damned if you do and damned if you don't.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Damned if I do, damned if I don't.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>If I go one way at everybody, it doesn't seem to make a difference one way or the other.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And then if I'm just quiet and just falling with the crowd, it doesn't matter either.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like it feels like you only have two choices.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You can either approach the situation kind of on the attack with both guns blazing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's a good way to describe it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Both guns blazing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Or the alternative is to kind of go along and compromise yourself in some way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Of those two, which feels better or which feels worse?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The both guns blazing always feels better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Because if I go at somebody with full force and hit them over the head and just go at them, even if they turn away, it doesn't really matter.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Because I've already said my piece and said what I had to say.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But if I don't say anything and I just sit back and don't do anything, then it just gets me as angry as the both guns blazing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So it just eats me up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But it eats me up in here and I get even angrier than if I just blurt it all out and get it all out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, I can imagine that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>At least if you're going in there with both guns blazing, there's a way in which you can kind of feel okay about yourself in some way, even though you're not getting your needs met.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But somehow they're sort of giving in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's like you're giving away part of yourself in some way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seems to me that the dilemma is that you have no good way of getting your needs met right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You sort of desperately need something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There's no middle ground.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There's no middle ground.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I'm not sure exactly what that middle ground is right now, but I'm willing to work with you to really work on discovering what that middle ground is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does that seem worthwhile?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have to find a middle ground.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What are you feeling right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Just it bothers me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can't go one way or the other.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I try to do one thing and I can't do it.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There's a real kind of sadness there and maybe a hopelessness.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know what to do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It feels like there's nothing I can do.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah. You look at me, in the sense of what's going on for you</div>
