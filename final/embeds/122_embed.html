                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I suppose if I'm... If I'm honest, er, yeah, I drink about a bottle of vodka a day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, as I say, it's crept up, erm, er, a few years now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>A few years.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you make it a bit more specific?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Two years, three years, five years?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I mean, as I say, it's crept up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, initially I just used to have a couple of drinks after work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Cos I got a pretty responsible job and, erm, I just found a drink calmed me down, you know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And, erm, then I got more responsibility and I found a bit more alcohol helped me, so, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, I'm drinking about a bottle a day now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you'd say you've had about the last two years, three years?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, about that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>About that, OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And do you drink anything else apart from vodka?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, erm, after work I normally go to the pub and, er, I have two to four pints of bitter or lager.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right, OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And would that be every day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, especially, you know, Monday to Friday when I'm working.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But at weekends I normally go down the local pub and I have a few at lunchtime.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And how much is a few?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>OK, only about two to four pints.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right,</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then, so, on a weekday, you take about, you have about two to four pints after work and then you come home and drink about a bottle of vodka?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, well, no, well, I don't come home and drink a bottle of vodka.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I drink, erm, I drink during the day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So would you drink throughout... Not when I'm working, mind you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Not when you're working?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Apart from lunchtime.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Not when I'm at work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So when do you start drinking during the day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>On an average day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, after I'm up and dressed and have me breakfast at home.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right,</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>so after breakfast.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And again, when did that start?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>A couple of years ago.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>A couple of years ago, OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And what about the weekend?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is it the same at the weekend?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And would you drink, you go to the pub at lunchtime at the weekend, would you drink more than a bottle of vodka during the day at the weekend?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Er, no.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It would be about the same, would it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And are there ever regular times when you drink more than what you've told me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There aren't?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And is it just beer and vodka, would you drink wine?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, I don't.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>We used to drink wine, my wife used to, when we had an evening meal together, sometimes we had a bottle of red or a bottle of white together, half a bottle.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But since she started complaining that she thought I was, you know, really shoving it down my throat, er, she sort of nailed that on the head, so we don't do that any more.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And would you say you have to drink more to get the same effect from the alcohol?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, the same calming effect, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Same calming effect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you ever have days where you don't drink, or periods where you don't drink?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When was the last time you had that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Er, a few months ago now, when she really had had a go at me and I thought to myself, well, maybe I'll give it a try again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It wasn't the first time, but erm...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How long did that last for?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Oh, about three days.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Three days.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And in that time, did you experience any, any physical feelings at all?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, I did.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I was shaking, I got very shaky, I got... I was on edge all the time, I, I was not working properly and I was sweating.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I just felt absolutely lousy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you had to take time off work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, I didn't take time, I couldn't, I didn't dare take time off work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just said I had a bit of a cold.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Erm, but erm, I thought to myself, well, I can't carry on like this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And so I had a couple of large vodkas.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And that, that made you feel better?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And that got me back on the straight and narrow.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Did you ever feel, do you ever get those similar sorts of feelings in the morning when you wake up?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, it does.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I wasn't exactly over the moon when he suggested it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But, well, I suppose, you know, if it's a choice of coming to see you and then or my wife leaving me, I came to see you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't want to lose you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I can see that it's had quite an impact at home.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How's your drinking affected jobs or anything else?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>hasn't affected my job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What about relationships other than your wife with family, friends?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, any other serious consequences?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I suppose, yeah, I have to go to family dues and dragged along there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I mean, I don't.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I avoid mixing with my work colleagues socially.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I find that bores me because, you know, if I'm in the pub with them, I've tried it once and I found I needed a drink.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And, you know, I thought, well, I'm going to put me foot in it if I carry on like this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I left early and I just make excuses.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't socialise with them anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
