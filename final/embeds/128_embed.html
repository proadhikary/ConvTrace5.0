                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As always, thanks for watching.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hello, Sarah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How are you doing today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm alright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're alright?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I understand that you've come to counseling because you have a particular issue that's been bothering you recently.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I've been really stressed out at work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm getting to the point where it's really hard to handle things that are going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So work-related problems.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you okay talking about that today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I need to, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So what I'd like to do in the beginning is kind of set a plan for our meeting today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And we can move off that plan if we need to, but I'd just like to start with that and give us some structure to what we'll be doing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So first, and this is something I want to co-create with you, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So your input is extremely valuable to it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I don't want to just lay it out and we follow it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I want you to be an active part of putting this together.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So as I throw out some ideas, let me know if it's something that makes sense to you</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>or doesn't.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'd like to start by having you explain in depth kind of what you're going through at work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I want to hear that story.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Then I'm going to look for some patterns in the way you're thinking and see if there's something that I recognize and all that, something I can point out that may help you a bit.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And we'll get more to that later.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then to kind of, as we wrap up, move toward the end, maybe start getting some ideas of things you can do between sessions, between now and when I see you next time, that can help combat these symptoms, make you feel a little better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does that seem like a fairly straightforward agenda?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Any changes or anything you'd like to make to that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, I think as long as you think I can tell my whole story in enough time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, we'll see.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We'll see.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You just kind of tell me what's going on as you feel comfortable.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And don't worry about the agenda, but just know that overall that's kind of what I'm thinking about for the structure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then as we wrap up, we'll set to make an appointment next time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And like I said, we'll end up with some ideas.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I hope they can help you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So let's get started with kind of your experience with all this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So tell me about your job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I'm a caseworker and, you know, what I do, I usually go into people's homes and, you know, talk to the families, do inspections, that kind of thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And, you know, I've been doing it for a while now, not too long, but about five years.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And overall, I like my job and everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But just, you know, something happened at work and it just really kind of, I just feel like one minute everything was fine and now it just feels like everything's really out of control.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So, you know, I was just, you know, doing my normal job, making reports and everything like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And, you know, I made a report about this family that I felt, you know, maybe the children weren't getting quite what they needed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They seemed malnourished.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The house was really unclean.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, I suspected that the parents were using drugs there and it's just really not a good environment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And, you know, it turns out that the kids were taken away and, you know, the family, it just, I'm like really freaked out, you know, maybe the kids aren't doing well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They're away from their parents.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Even though it wasn't a great environment, I know that the kids really love their parents and it's just, it's really, really weighing on me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And it's become kind of like a really big issue at work, I guess, where like everybody knows about it and, you know, I just feel like I tore this family apart and I don't know if I made the right decision and I just, it's like, you know, I used to just, I used to be so confident in what I did and now I just feel like I'm second guessing everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this is really stressful on you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, you like, so I make sure I understand, you like your job, but this, this dealing you've had with this particular family and what happened as a result of that dealing has just really thrown you for a loop.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's making me not like my job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I wake up in the morning and I'm like, I should just pretend I'm sick.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't want to go, you know, I just feel like, you know, at night I'm more stressed out, you know, maybe I have an extra glass of wine and I just feel so on edge all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it's really drastically changed your work experience.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I used to enjoy going to work and, you know, feel fulfilled and now I just feel like I do not want to go at all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So there's a sense of dread, anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel down at all?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, definitely.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think anxiety more so, but I definitely feel down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like, you know, even on the weekends, sometimes I just wake up and I want to stay in bed and, you know, I just, I feel like I'm having a good time and then I remember what happened and it just brings me back to that place and I'm just, I don't like it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not a good feeling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
