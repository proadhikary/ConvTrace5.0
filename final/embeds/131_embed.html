                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi, this is Dr. Grande.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I hope you find this video useful.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>If that's the case, please like it and subscribe to my channel.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As always, thanks for watching.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How many times have you gone to work and made a mistake?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I guess none technically, none that have been something I've gotten trouble for or anything like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes it's hard to tell because you don't always hear from people afterwards.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You can't really tell was it a mistake or not, but I guess none that have had any major consequences.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So none, but there might be a few small ones that you just never found out about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So less than a tenth of a percent of the days you go in?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Probably.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Very small.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, really, really small.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the probability of the statement that you're making being true is pretty low.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>The statement, the thought rather, that I'm going to make a mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Probably not supported by the evidence.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess that's true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the automatic thought is not accurate and not useful.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's got a couple of strikes against it, but it is the thought you're having, so let's deal with it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm going to make a mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So what could you tell yourself as the first part of the adaptive response, which acknowledges that fear?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's realistic, that acknowledges that fear of making a mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess everybody makes mistakes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Everybody makes mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I could make a mistake today, but it's unlikely?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That also be accurate?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So everybody makes mistakes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I could make a mistake, but it's probably not going to happen.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not that I'm going to make a mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're going to have that automatic thought either way, likely for a while, until you start to apply these adaptive responses.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this is what we're working on, is your response.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So everybody makes mistakes, I could make a mistake, but it's probably not going to happen.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And what could be the next part, which is realistic but also positive, that can help get you past the reaction of being late in the morning?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm a good case worker and I need to do my job so I can help other people and it's going to be okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, so there's a few elements in there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's going to be okay, I need to do my job, I help people, all those are true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So applying, now even as you say this here with me, as you say it's going to be okay and I need to do my job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What reaction are you having right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean it feels a little better, it's hard to, you know, I still feel like it's dangerous, I might make a mistake, but I guess it helps a little bit.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you see yourself being able to, in the moment, and I realize this is difficult, but in the moment of having that automatic thought, having that worry come in, can you see yourself applying this self-talk?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think I probably will because now it will be hard to have those thoughts and not think of you and think, okay, I need to calm myself down a little bit because we've been talking about it for so long.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you've already used self-talk on your own before you even knew about these strategies.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yep, that's true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And it did help in the past.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>A lot of the, or I should say some of the effectiveness of this is based on your ability in that moment to take a step back and follow the training.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Just like many professionals, professionals depend on their training to help them make the correct intervention, correct decision.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So think of this kind of like something you've learned in a training.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>This is a self-talk, it's pre-packaged, it's ready to go.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You can even have it written down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It doesn't have to be short, it can be like a paragraph or more if you wanted.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it's a matter of following the protocol.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you have the automatic thought, it's easy to descend into worry and fear.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're just looking to grab a moment in there and apply this treatment, this strategy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does that make sense?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Sometimes it's likely, well most of the time I think you would be able to do this, sometimes you probably won't.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it's important in those moments to not get discouraged.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you can have a self-talk for that too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And like Dr. Groundy said, it was likely that once in a while I wouldn't be able to do this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's not going to work every time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does that make sense?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it's the chaos of life, right, and the chaos of emotions that sometimes interfere.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>The more times you have success, that seems to be tied with a better chance of improving and reduction of symptoms.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But allow yourself failures as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's what I would expect from anybody trying to untangle all these feelings and thoughts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There's not going to be a perfect connection between an automatic thought and applied self-talk.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So be easy on yourself as you try this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That makes sense because if you could just flip a switch, I would only have to have one therapy session.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It would be in good shape.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it's a little more difficult than that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But overall, these strategies are fairly straightforward, and you can definitely learn them, and you can definitely do them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I want you to have that confidence.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's normal to have mistakes occur, and to not always do it as you need to, or as you want to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But in the end, overall, you should be able to apply them, and actually it will get easier in the future to develop your self-talk for different thoughts.</div>
