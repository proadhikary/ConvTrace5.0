                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you mentioned before that when you wake up in the morning, you don't want to go to work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What's going through your mind?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm going to have to, you know, hear what my coworkers have to say about what's going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I might make another mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Who knows if I'm going to find out that something terrible happened to these kids when I go back to work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess a lot of stuff like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So looking at the one, I'm going to make a mistake, this kind of connects to what we were talking about before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>This is the uncertainty.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're not sure of your own skills.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you're afraid of an error that's going to be costly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So when you think that thought, I'm going to make a mistake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this is when you're in bed before you start your day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you have that thought.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What happens right then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel more anxious.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, I think about like what could happen to somebody else if I make a mistake, like kids going to the wrong home or, you know, not being with their parents when their parents, you know, were not doing anything wrong.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I just feel really like overwhelmed and it gets hard to breathe and I just want to go back to sleep and not have to face anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So there's an emotional consequence and then the behavior is you don't want to get out</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>of bed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been late a lot more lately because I have trouble getting out of bed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And when you're staying in bed, are there more thoughts coming up?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean if I don't go back to sleep, then I have more thoughts like, you know, well, I need to go to work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>If I don't go to work, then I'm going to be late.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Then people are going to notice me and they're going to be thinking about what happened and thinking there's something wrong with me and that she's not good enough to do her job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, I don't want people to know how stressed out I am because then they're going to doubt my abilities just like I do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this is really weighing on you and you've identified these thoughts that seem to be connected with feelings that are unpleasant and behaviors that are unpleasant, but also maybe not useful, that are impeding.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, they're keeping me from getting to work and stuff like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So we have a reference point for later on as we continue counseling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'd like to scale this problem, like maybe I'll scale one to ten, where ten represents feelings that are nearly unbearable, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And one not really a problem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How do you feel on that scale?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Where do you rate yourself right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right now in this moment, probably like a five.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's right around the middle.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, like I'm really stressed out but I'm not, like when I'm in bed, like I can't get out of bed, that kind of thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How would you rate yourself when you're in bed before you go to work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Probably like an eight.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that as bad as it gets?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>With this feeling, it's about as bad as it gets, maybe sometimes it gets to a nine.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, I still feel like I can function but it's really, really difficult.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So an eight, sometimes a nine, and right now five.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So still not feeling great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And if you had to pick an emotion that was standing out above the rest, in the anxiety, sadness, sense of dread, what would be the worst right now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right now, probably anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So a five, on a scale of one to ten, that anxiety should be standing out more.</div>
