                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like this therapy is just like, I'm not getting anywhere.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like it's just not like doing anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So yeah, it's uncomfortable to talk about because it's just like, I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>My sense is that you were trying to say something and then you just kind of almost like gave up there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I don't know what, I'm trying to talk about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I don't know what else like you want me to do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I told you that I'm not feeling like I'm getting something out of the therapy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I'm being pretty clear, but I guess I'm not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you feeling angry at me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I'm feeling angry that the therapy isn't working.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I've been saying.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling angry that like I'm still in the place that I'm in, even though I've been trying.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm like just feeling like pissed in general, you know?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, you know, I understand that you're pissed in general, but are you angry at me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I mean, it sounds to me, my sense is that you're feeling angry at me right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>If you are, I really want to know about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I mean, I guess there is a part of me that's like a little, yeah, a little angry that you're not helping me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I came as therapy because I wanted to feel better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And yeah, I mean, I guess I am feeling angry that that's not like what I'm getting from you, even though that's what I'm trying to get.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, yeah, you're sounding really exasperated to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How does it feel to tell me about this?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It feels hard.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I'm, it feels hard to say that I'm angry.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like not a feel, it's not a comfortable thing to say or not a comfortable thing to feel.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just like makes me like, it's not, it's just like, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, you know, I don't want to push you too hard, but can you say any more about what you're, what's uncomfortable about this?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I mean, I do understand that it's uncomfortable.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, it's not something I would like ordinarily say to someone that I'm angry at them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So it feels like, I feel like I'm kind of anxious now, like even saying it, like, I don't want you to think I just like, that it's like your fault.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It just like feels like I'm like, that's something I'm really not supposed to say.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I mean, part of it sounds like is you're concerned that I'm going to feel like you're blaming me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, yeah, I guess.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't want to do that, but yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But it is hard to feel like this, I feel like I'm alone in this therapy that like, I've been coming here and trying and I'm just not like getting anything from you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that, that sounds really important, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It sounds like you're, you know, it's hard to say this to me, but you're, you know, you're feeling angry at me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maybe you're feeling disappointed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're feeling all alone.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like you can't even really talk with me about this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It feels really hard.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I want to be able to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm really glad that you're, you know, that we're talking about this and you're able to tell me more.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How are you feeling about, about, you know, talking about it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I'm still feeling a little anxious, but I mean, I think it's, but it feels better that it's like out there, I guess that I've like said it and I think maybe that helps.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So at least it's out there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So maybe we can go from here.</div>
