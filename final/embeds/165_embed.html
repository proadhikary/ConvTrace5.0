                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My educational assistants have been mean to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They always put me in timeouts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm really pressured.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I'm going to give you a prescription for an antidepressant medication.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you bring it home to your mom and show it to her and then get it filled?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'll take that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's none of your business.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, so I'm just going to go to my computer and put it in and then my receptionist will print you off the medication.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So good luck, Victor.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi, Victor.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm Dr. Sawyer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm a psychiatrist.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you know what a psychiatrist is?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So a psychiatrist is a doctor who deals with people who are feeling sad or mad, different feelings that they might have.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We'll talk for a little bit and we'll talk about some things that might have been difficult in your life over the past little bit.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And our goal is to try to make things, see how we can make things a little bit easier for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>When I'm at school, I feel like they're not doing anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They're not listening to me about how my feelings are.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you feel pretty unheard.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel unheard at school.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My parents and my sister are hearing me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you said you've been feeling pretty sad.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How long have you been feeling sad for?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, there's one teacher.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I won't give out any names, but she doesn't listen to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>She just tries to keep me down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How long have you had this teacher for?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>About four years.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Four years.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So have you been feeling sad for this entire four years or a shorter period of time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Shorter period of time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So has it been a couple weeks, a couple months, a couple days?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>A couple months.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So Victor, I want to tell you some of my thoughts of what I think is going on, but I want to invite your sister in because I need to find out a little bit about your medical history.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I'm just going to get her and then I'll come back, okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I've been talking to Victor and he's been telling me about how he's had less interest in things, he's having trouble sleeping, he's feeling sad all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it does sound like he's been suffering from what we call a major depression.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And there's a couple of treatments that I want to talk about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you know what medications Victor is on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, so I actually brought a list because there's quite a few.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can certainly give you all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Thank you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, so on this list it says about sort of what medical illnesses he's had and hospitalizations and surgeries as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There's a couple of treatments for depression.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>One is medication and one is also doing some interventions within the school and within the family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And there's a lot of things to think about, but it seems like things in the school have been really not going well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And that's been a major contribution to his sadness.</div>
