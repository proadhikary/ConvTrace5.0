                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just feel like everything's going to be okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>This is unusual for you because usually you come and talk to me, cut down, depressed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Something changed recently?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just feel like I've found the solution and I know what I'm going to do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not really worried about my depression so I guess I'm feeling a little bit better about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me about the solution you found for depression?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know we've talked about it before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that I'm going to commit suicide.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You want to commit suicide?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you know how you did that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have some pills in my house in the medicine cabinet and I'm going to take those.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When do you plan on doing this?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Probably a couple days from now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have some things to get in order.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I want to arrange things and make sure that everything's in order and then I'll do it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What kind of things do you need to arrange?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I want to make sure that all the documents my husband's going to need, that they're in a place that he can find them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not going to tell him but I don't want to make things more difficult for him.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Just that kind of thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Make sure that everything's in order so that when I'm gone everybody has what they need.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Jill, you've been seeing me for almost a year now and you know by telling me this that I'm going to act to stop you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm going to try to stop you from killing yourself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I want to do it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think in the end it's what's going to make things better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I guess there's still a part of me that doesn't want to die, doesn't want to do that to my family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I guess I'm telling you because I'm not 100% resolved and I guess I wanted to talk it over.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You seem pretty serious though about your timetable and your plan.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, it's like when you plan to go on a weekend trip.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You're pretty sure you're going to go but if the weather's bad you might not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I think, you know, I'm pretty sure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is there anything that can stop you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't, I think, I mean, I feel pretty sure about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel like it's the depression or something else that drove you to this decision?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like, I feel like it's just, you know, the same old things that I was worried about before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, the depression and, you know, my relational issues, my job, like the stuff that gets me down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And, you know, it just clicked and it was like, you know, I've thought about it before but like I feel like I'm going to feel better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like it's just going to, I'm going to feel better so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you said, it's a solution.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I feel like you come with a solution.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, now we've talked about this issue in the past, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And when you've come in feeling this way, kind of resolved to harm yourself, we sent you over to the hospital.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know that's not your favorite place but when you go there for however long, it's been usually about five days, you come out feeling a lot better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel like this time would be different?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I feel like in the past, you know, I've been thinking about killing myself seriously but now I'm not as scared of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I don't really want you to put me in the hospital because then I won't be able to do it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And before I was scared so I wanted you to put me in the hospital but now I just want to get it over with and so I really don't want you to do that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, like, it's like a part of you saying that you don't want me to stop you but yet you came in here and you told me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So a part of you seems to be maybe not quite sure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess there will always be a part of me that's a human, you know, that's scared to die and I care about you, you know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know you're my counselor but like we've had a relationship and we talk about these kinds of things and I felt like I owed it to you to, you know, be honest with you about how I was feeling because we've had that relationship in the past.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And so I guess I came here because of that and because I felt like I just wanted to talk it over, you know, before I did it because, you know, I come to you to talk about what I'm thinking and so I felt like this would help me like gain the final clarity that I needed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Has it helped you gain any clarity?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I see that you're saying that like I really need to go to the hospital.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I was hoping a little bit that you would be happy for me that I was feeling better but I think that you want me to go to the hospital so I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It makes me think about whether it's the right decision, you know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You mean the suicide?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Sometimes, you know, you've been with me like I said about almost a year now and you've been depressed much of that time and it's not unusual when somebody thinks they've found a solution to depression.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Even if that solution is something that I am against like suicide that their mood would become elevated because you see an end to the pain.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There's other things we can do and have done in the past to try to get you out of pain.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But we have done them in the past and I didn't feel better and now I am feeling better so, you know, I just want you to accept that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But I'm not going to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's my obligation that I'm happy to fulfill to try to keep you alive.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I've seen you this way before and I know it may not seem this way now but when you came out from the suicidal thoughts and the feelings you did well for weeks, sometimes months at a time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're seeing really just the darkest when you're in the...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, but I'm feeling better now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Temporarily.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Sometimes you feel you've found an end to the pain.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Which I understand.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I mean I understand you're feeling better but you're feeling better because you plan on killing yourself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And we've talked about how devastating that would be to your family, right, to your friends.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You have all these goals in your life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, but I'm just torturing them with my sadness.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just making their lives miserable.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't understand how it's going to help them for me to stay alive.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, I'm worth more.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They can have my life insurance and, you know, I won't make them suffer anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So your logic is that if you end your life, you'll free them from having to deal with you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It feels like the right thing to do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you know, I mean, you've signed releases.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I've talked to your husband, your parents.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>They repeatedly said that despite sometimes the challenge of dealing with your depression, they would much rather have you alive.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Why would they say that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that they're scared of the pain of losing me but I know that they'll feel better eventually.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So they'll get over the grief.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I understand.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I think that they'll understand that I needed this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You know, I've been doing this for a while, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think we've come to have a good relationship.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I would hope that I've earned your trust and your value in my opinion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can I share with you something that I know about suicide?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You open hearing it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There's a lot of ways that people die, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it's really what eventually will happen to us all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's hard for me to imagine a way more devastating than suicide.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Meaning when somebody dies of an illness or a car accident or any other type of tragic accident, people grieve, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But there's usually not a blame assigned to that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I mean, they don't feel guilty.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does that make sense?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>They feel sad because they've lost the person but they don't feel responsible for that person's death.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Suicide is different.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When somebody commits suicide, their family and friends feel responsible.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>They have no answers to all the questions that they have.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>They can never get answers.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm going to write them a note and tell them everything and tell them it's not their fault because it's not their fault and I just want them to be happy without me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you believe the note will take away all that pain?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, but I think that it will help them realize that they shouldn't feel guilty like you're saying.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It will mitigate that pain?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can tell you from experience that notes don't really help.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>If anything, it's another artifact that they can agonize over.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know it's hard to see from your perspective because you're kind of resolved to this and you feel stuck in the pain and you want out, but they will miss you and they will agonize for the rest of their lives because they lost you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it's a special horrible type of agony that comes with feeling responsible for causing someone's death.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I know you don't want that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just want to feel better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just don't know why you can't let me feel better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know it's frustrating and I know it's hard to understand.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>The times when you've gone to the hospital before, you have felt better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Your outlook was completely different.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Not 100%, but it was completely different when you came out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I mean you're still a little down, but nowhere near the depression where you'd want to hurt yourself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is it possible that if you go to the hospital this time, you could come out feeling better again?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's possible.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm going to make arrangements to get you over to the hospital.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't want to go to the hospital.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know you don't.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And we've had this conversation before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I realize that you're not happy with some of the conditions there, but you usually talk finally about the groups.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You usually do well in the groups.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And typically, well every time you've been to the hospital you come out feeling better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know it's not what you want to hear.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know you want me to be happy that you're going to end your life, but that wouldn't make me happy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That wouldn't make anybody happy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know you think it would make you happy, but I can tell you it's not the answer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'd like you to go voluntarily through this process.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Will you do that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Go.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You'll go?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Alright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I'm going to make arrangements to get you there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And when you're there and they're getting ready to discharge you, make sure you set up an appointment to see me right away.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Because usually I'm going to keep you about five, maybe ten days at the most.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I know they take care of this, but I'm going to ask you this too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Make sure that you have an appointment set up to see me so I can see you right after you get out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you do that for me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Alright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm going to go make those arrangements and we'll get you over there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We'll get you over there, okay?</div>
