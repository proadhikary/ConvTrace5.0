                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So Steph, I know you just want to go home.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you don't want to be admitted.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>However, I'm really concerned that you swallowed a whole bottle of pills last night because you were feeling down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you think you're going to do that again?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, I'm feeling a lot better now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It was a stupid thing to do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not going to do it again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm still really concerned about you and I need to know that you're going to be safe when you leave here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I need you to fill out the safety plan to ensure that you have strategies in place to cope when you're feeling down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't really feel like filling out a plan.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't need a plan.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, I think that you do need a plan.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You obviously needed a plan last night when you swallowed that whole bottle of pills.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I want you to fill out the safety plan to ensure you have strategies in place in case you feel like this again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's a condition of your discharge.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I really don't want to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>This is really concerning for me, Steph.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Perhaps you need to be admitted.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Fine, I'll fill out the plan.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So Steph, I know you probably want to get out of here and go home and that you don't want to be admitted.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It must have been a really scary experience for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I want you to know though that any time you're feeling unsafe or at risk of harming yourself, you're always welcome to come back to the emergency department.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm wondering what you think might have been helpful for you if this happens again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't think it'll happen again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was feeling really down but I don't really want to die.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Must have been a really hard experience to go through.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm wondering if you think it would be helpful to have some kind of plan in place or some strategies if by chance you feel like this again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What do you think might be helpful for you to think about or to do if you did feel like this again?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I could have called someone.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Oh, so that's a good idea.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Who do you think you might have called?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe my Aunt Jenny.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>She's great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>She's really easy to talk to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it's good you have someone in your life that you can talk to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What do you think stopped you from calling her last night?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It was so late.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I didn't want to call at like 3 in the morning.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It would have woken her and my uncle and all of my cousins up and they'd probably just be mad.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're worried about disturbing them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I imagine that your Aunt Jenny probably would have been okay with you calling her given the circumstances and how you were feeling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you think you'd be okay with maybe having a conversation with her about her being an emergency contact for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm wondering maybe if I could bring your dad in right now and we could maybe all talk about this together.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Tom.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Steph and I are just having a conversation about safety planning and I'm wondering if you want to join us.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Sure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So Tom, Steph and I were just talking about who she might contact in the future if she was ever to feel this way again and she mentioned her Aunt Jenny.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yes, I think that sounds good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Steph and Jenny are pretty close.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm wondering Steph, are there any other things you can think of that would help you in the moment if you're feeling this down again?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I haven't been doing the stuff I usually do for fun like reading or going outside or hanging out with my friends even.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>She also likes going for walks late at night when she can't sleep or isn't feeling good but I'm just not that comfortable with that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that's concerning for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It helps a lot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The fresh air clears my head.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm wondering Tom, is there anything that Steph could do to make you feel more comfortable with her going for a walk?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I guess.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>If she were to let me know before she left and maybe text me part way through to let me know where she is and when she might be home, that would help.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Steph, is that an okay compromise for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, so we've talked about a few strategies today and sometimes people find it helpful to write them down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I actually have a template for a safety plan so we could write down what we talked about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>The other option is you could use the notes section of your phone.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do either of those sound helpful for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe using the notes section on my phone.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I always have it with me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So let's recap what we talked about today.</div>
