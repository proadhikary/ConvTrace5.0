                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, Carmelo, I want to take a couple of minutes and go over the skill and anger that you filled out when you got here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You had mentioned that some people in your life have kind of commented and they said, you know, maybe you ought to look into thinking about whether or not you have some issues with anger or not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And that's one of the reasons you're here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I'm hoping that this will help sort of identify specific issues related to anger that might be problematic for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And so this is really feedback meant for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You can do whatever you like with the information.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's just for you to consider it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And so let's go through each area.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And there are a number of questions here and a number of sort of different anger dimensions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I think the place we're going to start is if you look at all the questions that you answered, it comes up with something called a total score, which is just kind of looking at everything together.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And when we look at the total score, you scored quite high, actually.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You scored in a range that we would sort of call the 99th percentile, which means, yeah, which means that your anger is at a level greater than 99% of the population of men your age.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Are you kidding me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You know, that's kind of hard.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That high.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Kind of hard to hear it that way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It kind of surprised you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I didn't think I was going to rate that high.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I figured a lot of people was in my category, but I would have figured that I was probably in about the 60%, 75.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Just a little above average.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Wow.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's way up there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's a little bit high, and it might indicate that really anger does get you in trouble at times in terms of relationships and causing them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you've recognized that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've always recognized it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've seen it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've tried to deny it a lot of times, but then I've recognized it that I know I have issues.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this kind of just highlights that and puts a number on it in a sense.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So that's where the studies have been done.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're kind of comparing how you answered the question to the general population of the folks your age, but you're really in the top 1% of scores.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I didn't think I was that bad.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've got a lot of serious problems.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, the same thing that they do to me, I do to them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So a lot of times I'm surprised, especially in the environment that I live in, that I haven't gotten shot or stabbed or killed yet.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, it should definitely have happened, and I'm surprised it hasn't.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Because getting angry, saying things to people, not thinking things through can really put you at risk.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Exactly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Same things I can do to them for anger me to that point.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's the same thing as me getting them back for what they've said before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So it could go in vice versa aspects.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They could kill me, I could kill them.</div>
