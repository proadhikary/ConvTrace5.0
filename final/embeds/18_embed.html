                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm doing good, thanks.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>How are you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm doing well, thank you for asking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I understand you've been having some symptoms that have been bothering you lately.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me about that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I just moved into an apartment and it's the first time that I'm on my own.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I kind of had heard that someone got robbed and ever since then I'm kind of nervous about my apartment getting robbed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Someone who's robbed near where you live?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, someone in the same complex.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So sometimes when I'm sleeping I'll wake up in the middle of the night and I'll think did I lock the door?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Is the door unlocked?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I can't fall back asleep.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How long does it take you to fall back asleep?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes it takes maybe an hour or two.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And what are you thinking about during that time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just worried that I left the door unlocked and sometimes I'll hear sounds and I think maybe someone's in the apartment or I just get nervous.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just get scared that the door's unlocked.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds scary.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You said a couple hours, you stay awake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's a while.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this is troubling for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever gotten up and checked the door?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, I stay in bed and I just try to, but I just think about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right, so you just keep thinking about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does it get worse as that time goes on or does it get better?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What happens?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It gets worse.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean I try to fall back asleep and I stay in bed and I just think maybe I did leave the door unlocked and then I just keep thinking that maybe it is unlocked.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it kind of keeps cycling through the same.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you ever do anything to try to get those thoughts to go away like focusing on something else?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I have like a ceiling fan above me, so sometimes I'll just like count how many times it goes around and just try to distract myself from thinking about it, but I still think about the door being unlocked.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes it helps.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right, so you have a fear that somebody is going to enter or break into where you live and you're staying up at night thinking about whether the door has been secured.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's been troubling you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Anything else?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes if I'm leaving for work, I'll get to my car and I'll think I left the hair straight neuron and I'll think to myself, should I go back?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know what to do and I'll just like kind of debate whether or not I should just go double check.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just worried that if I left the straight neuron, something that would happen.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What do you think might happen?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>If I left the straight neuron, something, if I have like clothes or something and it's on a cloth, like that could burn or if it's, I just don't want anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't want the place to burn down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's what I'm nervous about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When you leave, you're thinking about, it was a hair straightener?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're thinking about whether you unplugged it or not or turned it off or not?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How long those thoughts go on for?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Normally I think about it before I get into my car and I'll be like, well maybe I should just go just to make sure I unplugged it and I turned it off and then sometimes during the day I'll be at work and I can't focus just because I'm thinking about, I'll come back and I'll see my apartment burned down because I left the straightener plugged in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I remember with the door you're saying that you struggle with those thoughts but you don't get up and check the door.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever come back and checked to see if something was left to want?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, I haven't but I just, I think about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like what if I did leave it on or plugged in?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're worried, anxious?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Afraid?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, definitely, all afraid.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And how often does this happen, like the cycle of thoughts?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Probably throughout the day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So every day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Every day, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And how long has this been going on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Ever since I moved I guess into the apartment, so about I guess a year.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this has been going on for a year?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And in that year timeframe has it become any worse?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How did it start out?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It started out with just, you know, I would go to bed and I would wake up in the middle of the night and think to myself, did I lock the door?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm pretty sure I locked the door.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And then I would just be fine.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I could go back to sleep and be like, no, I remembered I locked it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But then as it progressed I really, I would wake up multiple times throughout the night and I would, it would just keep me up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As you thought about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right, I want to ask you a few other questions to try to help me figure out what's going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever been diagnosed with any condition, like a mental health condition?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about a medical condition?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Never?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever used alcohol or any other substances?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And has this been the first time in your life you've experienced these symptoms?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like starting a year ago up until now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Never?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Anything like this before?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Emma, I'm going to get you in to see one of our counselors here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I appreciate you spending this time with me.</div>
