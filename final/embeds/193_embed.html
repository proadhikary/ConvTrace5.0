                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How's it going today for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, I'm just kind of the same as it's been for the last few months.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, not getting any better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Still feeling pretty down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, from last week when we talked, I mean, kind of talk about your situation, getting injured on the job, and if we're losing your job, you kind of get in the way you didn't want to do anything, and sleeping a lot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then your wife left you and took the kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I just went very hard on you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And so, when I had you take that inventory, um, answering all those questions, I kind of scored that, and in fact do have pretty severe depression.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So... Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I already knew that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Not a surprise.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess it's nice to get validation on that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So what I thought we might do today, if it's okay with you, is, um, there's a therapy I'd like to try with you to kind of address your depression.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's called cognitive behavioral therapy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I don't know if you've ever heard of that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I may have heard the name before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'll describe it a little bit to you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So if we can kind of work on that therapy to kind of help your depression, and I'm thinking this might impact a lot of areas in your life, getting to work and relationships and stuff, so you kind of focus on the depression right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then I'd like to, after I've talked about that and some situations where you're feeling depressed, if we can...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I want to give you some tools maybe to take home this week to kind of talk about the situations of your depression and thoughts and feelings and stuff, and then so next week we can have some concrete stuff to think about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does that sound okay with you that we do that today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean, I don't want to try anything, so...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, that's a big part of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Your willingness to try is a big key part in cognitive behavioral therapy because you're willing to do the work to get better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So... Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Let me tell you a little bit about the cognitive behavioral therapy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Sometimes it's called CET, just those initials.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it takes an individual, a situation that's happening with an individual, a thought that automatically comes into the mind of that individual, how it makes them feel, and then how they respond because of that feeling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So we'll take an example, like, tell me about the last time that you were feeling depressed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Uh, I'd say probably this morning.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What was going on this morning?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, I just woke up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it was like 10 o'clock or so and just couldn't get out of bed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you woke up and couldn't get out of bed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What's the first thought that came into your mind?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, I think at first I thought, you know, why would I get out of bed?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There's no reason for me to get out of bed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, my wife's calling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Don't really have many friends anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Don't have a job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, what's the point of getting out of bed this morning?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How'd that make you feel about yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Worthless, I guess.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, like, I don't really even matter.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just made me feel really, really bad and worthless.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Because of that feeling, what would you do?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Were you able to get out of bed or just stayed in bed?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Stayed in bed until I came here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was in bed most of the day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm going to congratulate you for getting out of bed and coming here today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's a big step.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm glad you're here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Me too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you often have those feelings when you're a person of worthlessness?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'd say most of the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's how I feel.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's kind of what causes it, I think.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And typically, is your response to that feeling stay in bed or...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, if I'm... Emogalizes you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, if I'm in bed at the time, then yeah, I won't get out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, sometimes I'll be on the couch and start thinking and feeling like that and then I'll just...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I won't move.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Just kind of just... lay there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Let me ask you, Tommy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you remember a time when you weren't depressed?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, before the accident worked.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Lots of times.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And spending time with my kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Tell me a little bit about those times.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When you can remember before the accident, when you were experiencing some depression.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um... I mean, I'd be laying in bed in the morning.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My kids would run, jump, and wake me up and kind of irritate me a little bit.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But, I mean, I love having them do that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Get up and make pancakes and have a big long breakfast.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And then, if it was on the weekend, then we'd go do something fun like go to the park or go see a movie or something like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you remember how you felt back then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How'd you feel when those activities were going on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just felt good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just... I mean, I felt loved by my kids and I loved them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It was just great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just felt good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Did it kind of feel like the opposite of worthless?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I mean, they needed you and you felt good and you felt loved and you felt engaged in their life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Absolutely.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It was the opposite of what I feel now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, sometime when you have these worthless feelings and not being able to get out of bed, do you think it would help you to think about times when you felt pretty good about yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I've never tried that before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I don't know if it'll work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'd be willing to try.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'd be kind of willing to try that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, maybe when you're feeling down, can't get off the couch, can't get out of bed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think of some times when it was different for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You were in a different situation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But, and you certainly didn't feel this way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You didn't feel this way because you felt loved, engaged.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Important part of you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's fun.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What about when you were working?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How did you feel about yourself at work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I worked in a factory and we made car parts and stuff and I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I felt like I was doing something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I was making parts that were going to go in a car, which then someone would use to drive to their job or drive their families.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So, I felt like I was doing something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like, I had a purpose.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Then the accident happened and I lost that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And that's when I started to feel worthless.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm glad you can still feel or remember some times when you felt that you did have a purpose and you felt loved and valued.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I know with depression, it's hard to get up and get out of bed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's some of the, and a lot of people will say, you know, if I, I'm going to wait until I feel better and then I'm going to get up and I'm going to get out of bed and then I'm going to do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>A lot of times with depression, what you actually have to do, you have to get up out of bed and do something and then you feel better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I know it's kind of hard to do that with these feelings that you're feeling right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, but I mean, I think that makes sense.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You said?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And sometimes it's helpful to have something scheduled or planned.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right now in your, in your life, tell me some things that you might enjoy doing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Might, could think about be worth getting out of bed in order to do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, I would say seeing my wife and kids, but I don't know if that's really an option right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, I always loved fishing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I always, always enjoyed doing that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When was the last time you went fishing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Uh, it was a long time ago.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, right before the accident happened.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you recovered enough from the accident in which you could go fishing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that a reality?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that something that you could do?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean, I think I could.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay, great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So fishing is something that, that would be an important.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are there any other activities or meeting with people?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And those remind me, is your wife out of town and your kids consider it a little bit more difficult to maybe see them on a regular basis?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, they're out of town.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Other activities besides fishing that you might enjoy doing or being with people or things you enjoy doing or need pleasure in life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I used to get together with my buddies and we usually had like a cookout or something at somebody's house and watch football or sit around and talk.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, yeah, we always, I mean, we all had family so as kind of, we'd all get together and just kind of get away for a little bit.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That sounds fun.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that something that might be able to be planned or you might be able to have a get together with at least one if it's not the whole group, you know, one or two of your old buddies?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean, I think, I think we could do that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I just hadn't talked to them forever.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Sure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, when I, after the accident, since I've been feeling so down, I haven't really made any effort with them at all and they kind of tried at first but then I just never followed up with any of them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I mean, I guess I might be willing to try.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's another good suggestion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>As far as what do, is there an activity you should do even by yourself, either playing an instrument or listen to music or exercising or watching movies or something that gives you pleasure that you don't necessarily need, I mean, fishing is a good one.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know you don't really need anybody else for but I'm just thinking in case your buddies were busy, I'm thinking of another thing you might want to do that brings you pleasure or something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, working out was always something that I did.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And how did that make you feel when you worked out?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, during the workout, I got tired.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I always felt really good afterwards.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Afterwards, okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, like I had done something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was like, I need to come up with something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So, yeah, working out is definitely something I used to do a lot, get a lot out of.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Now, those are some good suggestions of things that you might want.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's, you probably need to start out slow in scheduling some things but it's nice to have, if you can, something on your agenda every day in order for you to get out of bed for.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It might be a workout.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It might be going fishing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It might be calling a buddy to schedule something or it might be hanging out with a friend.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, Tommy, I'd like your goal this next week and you can write it on this piece of paper right here, kind of journal about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You know, put the date and go ahead and put, I'd like you to have some, you can first talk about maybe when you're in bed and can't get out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You can write about your thought, the automatic thought that's coming into your mind, you know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm in bed and the automatic thought is?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There's no reason for me to get out of bed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>No reason to get out of bed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then you use the word worthless, whatever that automatic thought that comes in your mind, write that down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then write down how that makes you feel.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then you mentioned often your action or your response to that feeling is just to stay in bed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, I'd like for you to go ahead and log those emotions when those situations occur, you know, the situation, the thought, the emotion and your reaction to it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But another thing I'd like for you to do is if you can schedule one event a day, alright, that you would enjoy doing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it could be a phone call, it doesn't have to be getting that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And give yourself a break.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Know that this is going to be difficult and you're going to start out slow and you're going to work up to it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But just one event a day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I want you to log as well, you know, where there is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I called my kids or I called my buddy to schedule something or I went to work out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I also would like for you to write down how you felt about yourself after you did that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>After the phone call, how you felt about yourself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>After the workout, how it made you feel.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>After you got together with your buddies.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So go ahead and document this progression and then log the different activities that's here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then we'll talk about it next week.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And we can talk about what's, you know, these automatic thoughts and then any of these activities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And if any of these activities are actually helping.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It might take a while, Tommy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You have to be patient with the process, be patient with yourself and other people.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I mean you mentioned a while ago that your buddies, you know, they tried connecting with you and it was maybe difficult.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And they'll probably be glad that you're wanting to reengage with them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that might be an encouragement to you as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So is this something that you can work on this week?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does it feel overwhelming or?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean I feel good about that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean it's just going to be different.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But like I said I'm willing to try whatever I need to right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think that's a good part of this, the willingness to try.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And the patience that's going to be the process and take time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But we'll go through this step at a time and we can talk about it and see what's working and what's not working.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And we can make changes on it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But I think this CBT really helps you think about, you know, what's going on and why am I feeling this way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You know, identifying the thoughts in your mind and why I might be thinking of this and why I'm reacting because of this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you might even rate your emotion and say, yesterday I felt, you know, my feeling of worthlessness on a scale from 1 to 100 was 90.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But today it's actually 80.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And maybe next week it might be 70.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So if you want to add a particular number to associate your, the association with that feeling of worthlessness, if you want to kind of put a value on it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And we can kind of see how that adjusts with time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That might be helpful.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That sounds like it would be helpful.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We'll talk about that next time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you.</div>
