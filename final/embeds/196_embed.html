                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm Natasha, welcome to the service.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Nice to meet you Natasha.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Nice to meet you too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you want to have a seat?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Thank you for coming today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How did you get here?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Did you travel by car or train?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How did you find the traffic?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I drove today and the traffic wasn't too bad actually.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I got here in about 15 or 20 minutes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Oh, that's good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was held up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There was a big smash on the road so it took me a little bit longer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I'm glad that you were able to make it in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Julie, I'm glad that you've made the effort to come in today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How did you hear about our service?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I was talking to a friend and saying that I thought I might benefit from having a chat to somebody.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And she told me that one of her friends had actually come to your service before and said that it was very good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Excellent.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, thank you for coming in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When you came in, you filled out some forms, which the girls have given me, which is great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that gives me a little bit of a background to where you're from and things of that nature.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I just wanted to start by saying that our service is a counselling service for women.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And therefore you fit that category, which is really good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Now, I just wanted to let you know that this is our first initial interview, I guess.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So today we will be just setting some, I'll be hearing some of your story.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And we'll work through a little bit of a process.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then I'm sure we'll get the opportunity to meet again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That sounds good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Excellent.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Now, within the pack that I've given you, or the girls at the front have given you, Julie, there is some information on how we keep your privacy and confidentiality.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I just wanted to clarify that before we go into our session today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So within the community centre here, we do, everything that you say to me today is kept within a confidential environment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>However, I am a mandatory reporter, which means that if you tell me something that I feel that you may be at risk, or you may be at risk of harm to yourself or hurting someone else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>If you have children, if they may be at risk, or if you're participating in illegal activity, I am a mandatory reporter, and I will need to let somebody know about that so that we can try to get you some help and assistance in dealing with that particular situation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, that's fine.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Thank you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Excellent.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So Julie, let's just start by, what has brought you here today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, my husband and I have been fighting on and off the last couple of months, and I'm just noticing that we can't seem to come to any agreement lately.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm losing sleep, I'm feeling exhausted, and I'm at a point where I feel like I might like to leave the marriage.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How long have you been married for?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>We've been together for eight years.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Oh, wow.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's a decent amount of time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And do you have any children?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, we have three children.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have two little ones that are under five, and we have a seven-year-old who's at school.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you must be kept busy then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm always very busy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There's just always so much to do, and I'm really feeling very tired.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And the children today, whereabouts?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Who's looking after them today for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, my two younger children today are being cared for by my mum, and my oldest one is at school today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Excellent.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And where's your husband today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>He's gone to work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it seems as if you're at a point in your marriage where you're feeling as if the marriage has changed a little bit, and it's focused, and you're kind of a little bit worried about what the future holds for yourself and your husband.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel now that I can't come to any solution with the problems, and he's been drinking a lot, and he always enjoyed a social drink when we first got married, but I'm noticing now that he's drinking more and more.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>He seems to be drinking most days of the week, and when he does drink, he's very, very difficult to talk to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the alcohol seems to be a problem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you think that might be relating to the changing behaviour that you mentioned earlier?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, I do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that the drinking has definitely changed his behaviour significantly, and he's very unreasonable, and he has a very short fuse.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>He's very, very easy to make angry over the smallest of things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that must be difficult for you and the children.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you noticed if the children have picked up on the change in his behaviour?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, he does have a very good relationship with the children, and he actively participates in their daily lives, and the children haven't mentioned anything to me, and they don't seem to have changed their behaviour in any way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The arguments don't tend to happen in front of the children either.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are the arguments something that...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is it over more trivial things, or are there big, key things that you're kind of arguing with him about?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, the arguments can start over something small.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It can be just a simple argument over a task in the house.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That can escalate into an argument about his family, or about my mother, or about money issues, and it just seems to escalate out of control.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, Julie, have you...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>In terms of his drinking, I'm kind of just trying to ascertain maybe what has developed in your marriage that's taken you to the point that potentially, you know, you've come to see me today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it appears as if the drinking is really the focus of perhaps your feeling of, you know, wanting to disconnect from the marriage and feeling isolated within the marriage.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Would that be right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the drinking is my main issue with his behaviour, and I think the drinking is greatly contributing to the way that he's behaving towards me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you spoken to him about this?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've tried to talk to him about the drinking a couple of times, and he just gets very, very defensive with me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Potentially he's not acknowledging then that he may have a drinking problem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's correct.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I can understand that this must be difficult for you, Julie, and I'm pleased that you've come here today to try to, you know, work through some of these issues.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Now, Julie, in terms of, I guess, your commitment to the marriage, in terms of where you want the marriage kind of to go, do you think that you have a strong base that you can potentially, you know, if we were able to help your husband with the drinking side of things, that your marriage itself might be strong enough to overcome and to move forward in the relationship?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Or, you know, tell me a little bit about what your thoughts are with that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I'm hopeful that we could resolve the issues that we're having, and although at the moment I feel like I need to break away from him, if he was able to get the support that he needed and we were able to get the support together, I think that I would be willing to give the marriage an opportunity to continue and to resolve our issues.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Julie, in terms of your own support, you mentioned your mum's looking after the children today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you... Would you consider yourself to have friends and family that you...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You know, have you spoken to anyone else about this issue?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I have.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I spoke to my girlfriend who recommended your service, and she's a very good support to me and to the children.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I have a very supportive family network as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have sisters who live in Sydney and also my mum, so they're all around me and they're very, very caring towards me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have any of those...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Any of the family or friends noticed a change in your husband's behaviour?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, they have.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Actually, recently we had a social function and my brother did comment to me on how much alcohol my husband consumed at this social event.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this is impacting on you as well as the, I guess, the extended family as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, it's really good to hear that you do have a support network outside of this room, I guess, which is really, really good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it's great that you've got that, and I'd encourage you to use your mum and your family and friends, you know, as a gentle ear to listen, to, you know, to help you support yourself and the children through this phase or this stage in your relationship with your husband.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, Julie, I'm just trying to think about potentially...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Just to recap, so you're saying that your relationship with your husband has changed from what it was.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You've been with him for about eight years and you have got three children.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You've mentioned that the primary changes his behaviour and that you believe that it probably is linked to his change in drinking habits.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And from what I understand, you've expressed that you would be happy to potentially work with him to resolve or seek help for him in relation to his drinking habits.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How old do you... Would that be right in what I've said there?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, that's right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's correct.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I would be happy to work on things if he was willing to do that as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Not knowing your husband, I guess I would probably need to ask you if...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you think that your husband would be receptive to maybe some marriage counselling or going to see somebody about his drinking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is he the type of person that might be receptive to that or...?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think he would.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think if I was able to approach him when he was calm and relaxed, I think that, yes, he probably would be receptive to that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's positive.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's really good, because some people that I meet, you know, the answer to that would be quite different.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I think that's really positive for you, Julie.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I think what we probably need to look at now is maybe continuing this relationship between you and I.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I'd love to see you again and meet up with you again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But also, too, I think we probably need to explore that avenue of either getting you some marriage counselling or something along those lines, as well as seeing whether or not your husband might be interested in looking at some services to help him with his drinking issues that he has.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So if it's OK by you, what we might do from here is organise for us to meet again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What time is best for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Around this time is a good time for me, and any Thursday or Friday during the day is good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So what we'll do is we'll organise maybe for this time next week, and we'll meet again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But in the meantime, I think we probably need to put you in contact with a relationships counsellor, and we'll try to get that side of things going.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And as a result of that, we'll be able to work out how receptive your husband is of potentially seeking some help for him as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I would like to just say that you mentioned that you probably would like to escape a little bit from it at the moment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So perhaps I might be able to give you some advice or some information on some things that you might be able to do to take yourself away from that situation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>If you feel as if it's a little bit too much, maybe you might like to tap into your mum or your family and friends as well if you don't feel comfortable using some of the other services in the area.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How do you feel about that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That would be good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'd appreciate that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>OK.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, thank you, Julie, for taking the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm really happy that you were able to come in today, and I look forward to going on this journey with you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not a solution.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We can't fix everything here today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It will be a process.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But hopefully together we can see a really positive outcome for you and your family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you very much for talking to me today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's been great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I look forward to seeing you next week.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you very much.</div>
