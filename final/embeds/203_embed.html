                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this is a Breaking Bad News consultation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's a case of a 47 year old man who has been seen by one of my colleagues who had an ultrasound scan requested for some right upper quadrant pain.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And the scan was reported as saying that there was a potential mass in the head of the pancreas so the ultrasound department requested an urgent CT and I'm on call and the facts have just come through to me suggesting that there is a mass in the head of the pancreas and some potential liver metastases.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I have waited until the end of my morning surgery, booked a double appointment and let the girls know not to disturb me now that I'm not on call, and have rung the patient up and asked him to come in, told him that there's something on the scan that we need to discuss, offered for him to bring somebody with him and give him a bit of a warning shot and he's just arrived.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Come in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi!</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Hi there Doc.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have a seat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So we just spoke on the phone didn't we?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>My name is Dr. Evers.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know you've previously been seeing my colleague haven't you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, yes I saw Dr O'Donovan and he did that scan for gallstones.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay. So, what happened from there then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Just tell me a little bit about what's happened so that I'm up to speed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I went for that scan and then I was a bit surprised actually.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They actually rang me up a few days afterwards and said that I needed another scan to check things out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I was there, it was on Monday this week, when I went and they put me through that doughnutty thing and then you gave me room.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay. So, in between the scan happening and the second scan happening, was it the department that had rung you or had you spoken to Dr O'Donovan about it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, no it was a nice old sound girl who rang me saying they were booking this appointment for this extra scan.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And did they give you any idea why they needed to do an extra one?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No they didn't actually, I mean I tried to ask you always do, and like sweet talk a lady but she was not for telling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay and had you had any thoughts yourself or any worries about why they were calling you back?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guessed it was something in the gallstones.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So just tell me a little bit about what symptoms you've been having then, but we do have your scan result here today and there is something we need to discuss on it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'd just like to make sure that I know what's been happening to you first of all and then we'll go into the detail.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It all started a few months ago really with this tummy pain and then I saw your colleague and he said we'd better get his scan.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I went for that scan, it was only about two weeks ago and then I got literally four or five days later got the phone call that I needed this additional scan so I went on Monday and had that done.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, and so do you still have pain at the minute?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, yeah I mean it's just there all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, well as I said your scan result has come through to me today and I'm afraid there is something that's potentially a little bit worrying on it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Really?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I didn't expect that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So what's the worrying thing that you found?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, if I take you back to the first scan, first of all, so what it appears that that showed is that there was something suspicious on what we call the pancreas gland.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Suspicious?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So there is a gland at the top of your abdomen here which is quite close to your gallbladder and called the pancreas.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And when they did the ultrasound scan which is a good scan but isn't particularly detailed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There was something on it that they saw that they wanted a little bit more information</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that's why they called you back for the second scan.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Doesn't sound good, does it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That was a CT scan which is a detailed one so that we could see what it is that we're likely to be talking about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this second scan has shown that there definitely is something on your pancreas gland.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Really?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And when I say something, what we need to worry about is whether or not this could be a type of cancer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>God.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I didn't expect that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>God.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm only 47.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Cancer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I'm really sorry to have to break it to you like this but I felt that it was important that as soon as I knew that I communicated that to you and that you knew what we were thinking as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>God.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I mean I know that I've just dropped a big bombshell on you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Oh yes, God.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you got any questions at the minute?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you got anything that you've...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Erm, what's the pancreas and if I have got cancer, what can they, can they cut it out?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, it depends.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Basically your pancreas is a gland that sort of sits at the top of the abdomen as I said and it controls some of the sort of the hormones, the fluids that your body makes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, because it's at the back of the abdomen, often we don't know very much about it until it starts causing a bit of a problem like your pain that you've been getting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that probably explains why you've not had many other symptoms as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right, right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, the answer is I don't know what could be done about it but we need to ask a specialist what could be done about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What we usually do in this situation is ask a specialist to see your scan and I'll let them know today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>To have a look at your scan and to see you and to have a think about what this could be.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do they agree that it could be potentially cancer and how do we find out what it definitely is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then from that what we do about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I understand that I've just thrown a whole lot of information at you and that a lot of it is very worrying information.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Oh yeah, God, I just hadn't expected that at all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, I mean is there anybody that you could, that you could bring in with you and we could have another bit of a chat maybe tomorrow when you've had a bit more time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I suppose I could, I'll ask my mum because I hope by myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Erm, no, I'll come by myself actually.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You sure?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It'll just be easier.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>She'll just, you know, she'll just flat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I mean I think it's important to say that we don't know for definite what this is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We have to imagine that it is something like a cancer until we can prove what it is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, so we do everything very quickly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And try and get some answers for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, but we don't know any definite nothing certain at the minute.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, but I do appreciate that I've just given you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Some scary news.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, and they'll probably take a little bit of time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, so my door is open and I wonder if maybe we can get some answers.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, I've taken the liberty of printing off a little bit of something about pancreatic cancer if that's what this is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, for you to have a bit of a read through.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Some of it's a little bit, a little bit scary and as I said we don't know as nothing certain yet.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But I wonder if you might want to have a bit of a read through of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Before coming back to see me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Erm, so what this does is it just explains a little bit about what the pancreas is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right, okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>A bit more detailed than I've been able to today.</div>
