                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden that should help with the ear infection, but in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's really a big problem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's really upset.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoke exposure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you smoking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I do smoke, but I don't smoke around him.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I try really hard not to smoke around him.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke, and so what can you tell me about that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I try really hard not to smoke around him.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't smoke in the car.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>When he's home, I go outside to smoke.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I know it's bad, and I know it's bad for him, so I don't want him to be around him, so I try really hard.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I really need you to quit smoking, both for your health and for Aiden.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Did you know smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections, it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here, but also things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, asthma, other upper respiratory infections.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really putting him at a lot of risk.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>In addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, but I don't smoke.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've thought about quitting, but it's really hard, so I just don't know how to do it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, now's the time to quit.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking, not only for him, like I said, but also for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease, for all kinds of things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know, I know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've heard.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>People have told me before, I've heard all that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just don't know how to do it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>How am I supposed to quit?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's so hard.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, there's all kinds of things you can use now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's not as hard as it used to be.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You can use nicotine replacement.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's nasal spray.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We can talk about medications.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There's hotlines you can call.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just don't have time for any of that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>This is really important.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand that.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, everybody has problems, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just really, it's really, really hard.</div>
