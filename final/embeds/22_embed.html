                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hey Erica, how are you doing today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Good, thank you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're doing good?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I was hoping today we could revisit the two chair technique.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We used it a few sessions ago, you might remember.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I knew in the last session, I felt like we were kind of getting to a point where we identified a conflict.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You know what I'm referring to?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>What do you mean kind of between part of me that wants to settle down, but then part of me that also wants to pursue my career and what I'm doing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So we have a part that wants to settle down and a part that wants to keep going with the career.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So for this two chair, what I'd like to do is in the chair where you're seated now, this will be the emotional self, in this case the side that wants to pursue the career.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>From what I saw before, that seems like we're more...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's what I really want, yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're more emotionally connected, that's what you want.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that's what I want.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this will be the side of you that has the needs and the wants and more the emotion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that's who you'll be in this chair.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does that make sense?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>In the other chair, let's have that critic that's inside, that internal critic that's advocating for settling down, for getting married, for having kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>In a way it represents a societal pressure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do those two sides seem separate to you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You feel like you can be the emotional self here and the internal critic there?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I think you remember how this works.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You'll be talking to, in this case, the internal critic.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the internal critic's on the side of settling down, getting married.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then when you're ready to have the critic respond, you'll switch to that chair and respond to the emotional need-driven and wanting self.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Make sense?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So whenever you're ready, go ahead and speak directly to the internal critic.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I want to finish what I'm doing and I want to finish what I started.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've worked so hard on my career path and I'm so close to finishing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I want to finish for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I want to accomplish those goals that I've set for myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's something I'm passionate about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you made your statement.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you ready to switch?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, go ahead and switch.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So now you're the internal critic.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There's always time to pursue a career, but I need to focus on what's expected of me at this time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm the best age for having kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have a loving boyfriend who is ready and wants to get married and settle down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And you are being selfish by just following a path that you can take at any time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the internal critic cues in the emotional side, in this case the career side, being selfish.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And notice your posture is very linear and you're upright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And notice you kind of put your hand out a little bit when you were talking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Try to think of the internal critic's body movements.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Try to act that out a little bit.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it's accusations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just want to tell the emotional part that it's being stupid.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You're not acting in the best interest of everyone else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You want to jump at it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You want to jump at the emotional side?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that's the internal critic.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you ready to respond back to the internal critic from the emotional side?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the internal critic is just called selfish, among other things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>This is your response.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It feels like I'm being attacked.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I don't think it's wrong to think about myself and what I'm truly passionate about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Let me interrupt you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So your hands, they're pointing back toward the career emotional self.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What can you do with your hands that really embody what you want to communicate to the internal critic?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is there anything else you'd want to do?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right now they're pointing toward you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They're pointing towards me to protect myself from what the critic is saying.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just want to push that back towards the critic.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When you use that motion, you're pushing the internal critic away.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I don't need to feel guilty.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't need to feel selfish for wanting to follow my dreams.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does the internal critic have something to say back?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think the critic...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'll try.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'll try.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you've now pushed the emotional side, pushed the critic away.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I think the critic feels like it understands where the emotional side of me is coming from.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I can recognize why it's so important and why working so hard is worth that sense of accomplishment that's going to come with it and how it's going to, in the long run, help provide for all these extra things that I want to...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>like my family in the future.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can see that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the internal critic is...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Now you have your hands down here is the internal critic.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is the internal critic less angry, less assertive?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Less pushy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Less pushy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Less pushy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's not as critical, truthfully.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like the pressure isn't weighing on either's shoulders.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know what I mean?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the critic is more separated now, maybe a little bit, but also has a different outlook.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>More quiet.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's not like always yelling at me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Because I think it... I mean, sometimes it might still say something, but not in the urgency that it had before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the critic has lost some of its vigor and determination.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So move back to the emotional and then just face toward me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What have you gained here through your communication back and forth with the internal critic?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel calmer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like the critic has always been a part of me, but that part of me is more...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's not as assertive.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's not as intense right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's calm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that the emotional part of me was able to win the argument, per se, because that's what I want.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So at the end of this conflict, after we split into the two parts here, at the end of this conflict is eventually a decision.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's a decision to pursue a career or settle down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel you gain more clarity in that decision?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Because I feel like I can stay on... my decision is and has been to stay on my career path, but now I feel less guilty for doing it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that's really been your decision all along, but the internal critic was harassing you this whole time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Harassment is a good word.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Today you were able to shove that internal critic back a little and allow that internal critic to see how strong you feel with the decision you've made.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that accurate?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Very much so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel it was a helpful technique for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that separating the two sides helped me realize which one felt stronger.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it was able to give you some clarity?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, let's... I want you to reflect on what's happened here between now and the next session.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I guess kind of a lot happened and it seems like you've gained clarity for your decision and then we'll pick up with the next session and see how things have progressed with...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>See if that internal critic is still harassing you or if it kind of stays back and if you have more peace with the decision.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does that sound like a plan?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Thanks, Erica.</div>
