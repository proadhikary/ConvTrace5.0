                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The main thing is I'm just sleeping all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm really tired.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, I'm tired when I have to go to work and then I go home and I just sleep a lot and I think it's abnormal.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I haven't been eating as much lately.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've lost a bit of weight and it's just affecting my life so I just want to come in.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you have excessive sleep.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You feel like what is excessive sleep?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like just hours.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'll get home from work and I'll take a three-hour nap and then I'll wake up and do something that I enjoy but then it will be bedtime again and I'll be ready for bed even though I took a nap and I'll sleep in at any chance I can.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't wake up early or anything.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just, I don't know if it's just because I'm sleeping so much I'm not eating but I just like when I wake up it's not like, well I'm hungry, nothing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I just.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How long have these symptoms been present?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean I would say I've noticed it in the last two weeks or so.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Probably every day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Every day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right, so I'm going to ask you some other questions related to this, okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Just provide me the best answer you can.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>In the last two weeks have you found yourself depressed, sad, hopeless, anything like that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>No?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Not really.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you lost interest in activities that used to be fun for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, I mean I still like all the things I did, like all my hobbies, I like hanging out with friends and stuff.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes it's hard for me to remember to make plans with people and I just end up sleeping instead, but I genuinely enjoy it still.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'd like to go and see people do those things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you ever feel agitated in terms of movement, like you can't stop moving or find yourself trying to resist moving?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess like not so much I can't stop moving, but I do try to like stop.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess I do try to like stop myself from fidgeting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's been happening?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Any changes in terms of your level of energy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean like I said I'm tired all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes I just can't get up and late to work just because I haven't had the energy to get up and stop sleeping and wake up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, so the excessive sleep has affected your level of energy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about any type of feeling of worthlessness or anything like that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean I guess yeah, I mean I'm not, it sounds harsh, but I'm not really a valuable person really.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't have a very important job or anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No one really depends on me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You don't feel yourself as valuable?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean no, not really, but it is what it is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How long have you felt this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know for a while, you know, and you know when you don't contribute very much.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So it is what it is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about your concentration?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you found any changes there in your ability to concentrate?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>At work, yes, definitely.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Because I'll be tired and yawning and even when it comes to like outside of work I guess I'll forget to make plans with friends or forget, I don't know, little things, just little things that I do forget a lot and it's hard for me to pay attention to movies.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know if it's because I'm tired or not, like I just...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you have trouble focusing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you ever have any thoughts of death or dying?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Nothing like that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You mentioned that these symptoms have been causing problems at work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Any other areas where they've been causing you trouble, like limiting your functioning?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You mean like, like social life?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Social life, relationships, life at home.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean I live on my own and you know like sleeping all the time, like I don't see anyone else and you know it's hard to meet new people if I was looking for a relationship.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I would say it affects it because I'm not like putting myself out there or anything and you know I forget or I'll sleep instead of making plans with friends on a Friday night so that can't be good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about substances?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you use any alcohol or drugs?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You know like that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, I mean I'll drink socially but I haven't really.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Done that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about medical conditions?</div>
