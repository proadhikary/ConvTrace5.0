                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Watson.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Nice to see you again, Dr. Goldblum.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm glad you came back in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I've got the results now of the blood work that we did after your checkup.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Before we go over any of that, I really wanted to find out from you how things are going and what you're concerned about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I'm curious about them because I haven't been very well, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I haven't been feeling very well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Last week I threw up some blood.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that the first time that's happened?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, the first time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I threw up blood last week and then again yesterday.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There's something bad going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know there's something bad going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What do you think is going on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, cancer, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I probably have cancer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not doing very well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just not doing very well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Look, let's try to figure some of this out, okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When you said you were throwing up blood, were you throwing up bright red blood?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Was it little spots, big spots?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It was almost filling the toilet.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It wasn't that much.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It was enough that I could see it in the toilet when I was throwing up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Did you have any other symptoms?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I was feeling sick and I had headaches.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What time of day was this?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have headaches a lot throughout the day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But the throwing up the blood?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That was in the morning and then again the other time it was sort of later in the day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I also wake up in the middle of the night and I'm just covered in sweat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know that's another cancer thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, look, I can understand why you're worried, all right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Because throwing up blood is scary and waking up soaked in sweat in the middle of the night, that doesn't feel right either.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Let me ask you a couple of questions that might help explain things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When did you have your last drink?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Actually, just before I came here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, so that was earlier this morning.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What did you have?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I had orange juice and I had some vodka in it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's the only thing actually that like steadies me enough to get out the door.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't go out that often, but you know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So tell me how it helps you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It just steadies me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It steadies me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I'm, you know, I'm shaking all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just like.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So over the course of a day, in order to steady yourself, in order to feel calmer, how many drinks do you end up having?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Five?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Singles or doubles?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't measure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is it mainly vodka?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes if I'm feeling really like my stomach is really upset, I'll drink cider.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So that's cider or vodka.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And do you ever get that feeling in the morning that some people describe that they wake up feeling so edgy they need a drink to calm down?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like the only thing that works for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's the only thing that works to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So in the past week, do you think you've been drinking more?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>In the last week?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Not so much.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe the last couple of weeks, maybe.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Has it been daily?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Oh, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the longest you've gone without a drink in the last month would be how long?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know, actually.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've got, you know, I've got a lot going on, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So my sister is in Boston.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>She's got cancer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I know, like, I should be calling her, and I can't do that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My mom is really sick, and she's horrible.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I'm the only one who can go see her.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I go see my mother, and she just yells and screams at me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And she's got emphysema.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And it's just...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And so for all of those things, the alcohol helps?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And does it ever happen, sort of by the end of the day, that you have trouble the next day remembering what happened?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, you know, my days don't differ that much.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I, you know, I'll fall asleep in front of the television, and then...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not seeing lots of people.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I, you know, there's not big events in my life that I would be remembering.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just, you know, and especially now that I'm feeling so not well, that I...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, there's not much that I would have to remember.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you tried at all to cut down on your drinking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I did.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, I had a boyfriend who, you know, was sort of casual coming over.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And he basically said he couldn't be with me anymore because I drank too much.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And so I tried.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I tried.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's hard.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And then he laughed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So who cares, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Who cares?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But have you found yourself feeling guilty about the alcohol?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel guilty about my sister.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel guilty that I can't, like I just can't, I can't even call her.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I can't, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So if I could pull it together, then I could...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Because what I understand from what you're telling me is that the drinking helps meet a certain need for you in terms of trying to hold things together with all this stuff going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it meets a need in terms of trying to keep you calmer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But at the same time, it's getting you into trouble.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's getting into trouble in terms of relationships.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But it's also the most likely explanation for why you've been throwing up blood.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Is it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Why the lab results that I've got are consistent with an amount of alcohol that's too much for your body to handle.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Really?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Really.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And that means, ideally, that we're going to work together to find a way to do something about it.</div>
