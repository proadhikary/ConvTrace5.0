                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I noticed today your brother brought you in and he had some concerns about how your mood has been.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I don't know why because my mood has been awesome.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>For like a week I've been getting so much done, you know, at work, I finished both reports that I've been working on.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I haven't been sleeping as much.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I haven't needed it really.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I only need a few hours it seems like but it's been fine because I haven't been tired, I haven't been, you know, irritable or anything during the day and at night I get a few hours of sleep but for the rest of the time I'm like, you know, either working on work or my house or whatever so I mean, I'm sleeping less but it's not an issue.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, so you're sleeping less but you don't feel tired at all?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You feel okay?</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you find yourself more easily distracted by anything?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Things around you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, not really.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>No?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Nothing like that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How are things done at work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about at home?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I mean, so my dining room, I've been like, new china and stuff like that so I've gotten everything set up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, I hadn't finished unpacking all my boxes from when I moved in so I've gotten all the boxes unpacked.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, even like things like placemats and whatever, like it looks like a home now and I'm really liking what I'm doing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, so you're accomplishing a lot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Now, when your brother had brought you in, he had mentioned some shopping and that's one of the things he was concerned about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, well, so on the weekend, I had gone ahead and went shopping and I kind of went on a shopping spree and I had bought, like I said, my new china and I had gotten some kitchen utensils too and a couple things for around the house, like home decor.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I called him because I had ran out of space to take everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was at the mall so I was hitting a lot of different stores.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I had run out of space to put everything in because I really wanted to actually get a new dining room set, like tables and chairs and maybe a cabinet.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>He has an SUV, so I called him to see if he could come and so I could purchase the items, but he said he wasn't, he couldn't come out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess he kind of said he was worried about you spending that much money, which I don't, you know, I don't know why he would be just from me calling him, but I think that's why he was concerned.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But he didn't come.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I didn't get the dining room set or anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You remember how much you spent?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know exactly because there's lots of different stores, but you know, I have a couple different credit cards.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The one credit card I used was declined by the end.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So it was probably, you know, I didn't need to get the dining room set.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I could have used a different credit card, but obviously it's been enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel like you spent more than you usually would spend in a trip to the mall?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, you know, I never really go on shopping sprees.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I never like treat myself like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I mean, yes, but I, again, like I haven't, you know, I needed all those things that I got from my apartment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever had a time in the past when you felt this way where you felt really good?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Not like this, no.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>No?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's the first time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I just feel like, you know, life's falling into place right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Life's falling into place.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're feeling pretty good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You feel like things are going your way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're getting a lot accomplished.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Any sadness or anything like that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Any change in appetite?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You seem to have a good amount of energy.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Any thoughts of death or dying?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever had a time in the past when you felt depressed?</div>
