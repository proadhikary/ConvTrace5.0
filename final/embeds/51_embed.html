                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Your brother brought you in today and he had some concerns about your mood.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean he has but it's kind of weird because it's actually been great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's been great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's been great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I used to have issues with mood but I don't anymore and now I just, for the last couple days at least, maybe about a week, I don't know I haven't been paying attention but I have felt awesome.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've gotten so much done.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I do stuff at work, I do stuff at home, I went shopping.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I am doing great with, well kind of great with my interpersonal relationships.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was thinking about at work this week, I thought I was so proud of myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Firstly I got a promotion and also I was happy with that but then another one of my coworkers, he had his birthday so I was like, oh let me do something nice for him and I went home and I baked him a cake.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But it was kind of annoying because when I got there he got mad, which is stupid, because he said, he didn't appreciate the fact that it said over the hill but he's like old.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I thought it would be funny but it wasn't apparently.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But so, yeah besides that this week's been awesome.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I said I got my promotion and I made a lot of money with a nice increase I should say and I just, yeah so I've been feeling awesome, getting a lot done.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, I feel like you're getting a lot accomplished at work and at home and what types of things have you been doing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So there's a couple projects at work that I've been working on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I got all those done.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I, at home I have been working on unpacking because I moved in kind of a while ago but I still have boxes sitting around and stuff.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I got that all taken care of.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm completely unpacked.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Over the weekend I went and bought some home decor stuff so it really makes my house look just like I want it to look and I'm happy with it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, so your mood is up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Your brother specifically had concerns about spending money.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean he's worried because I went on a shopping spree.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So he doesn't really know how much I am making with this new promotion and I didn't really want to tell him.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I might actually because I'm proud of myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I deserve it and I've worked so hard for so long at this company.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So with the shopping spree I was kind of like treating myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And so I went out and I did spend a lot of money.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I actually maxed out one of my credit cards but I don't have a lot of bills right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I paid off all my debts and I finished paying off my student loans too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I could pay for it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So that's why he's worried.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I called him because I ran out of space in my car and I was going to try to put this table that I was going to buy on top of my car but it didn't have one of those things to attach it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So it didn't work out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And so I think he kind of got worried because he thought I was buying too much.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I returned that item because obviously I couldn't fit it in my car and he couldn't come help me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But besides that I've been fine.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright so you haven't gotten any trouble at work or at home or anything?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No not at all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean like I said I got a promotion at work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My bosses are extremely happy with how productive I've been, how much I'm getting done, the quality of my work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm able to like look over the reports and everything I turn in several times before I do it and I always make sure I do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Any changes with your sleep habits?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes and no.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean yes because I haven't really been sleeping as much as I used to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I used to sleep too much but like I haven't needed to this week.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But it hasn't been an issue.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's actually been a good thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So how much did you sleep last night?</div>
