                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Not listening.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I took the phone, threw it out the window.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So do you find that you're angry often?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I wouldn't say I'm angry often.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just think is if people did what I wanted them to do, what I wanted them to do it, I wouldn't be so upset as much.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you find yourself upset on occasion?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>On occasion, but again, it's just if people would listen.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like, I don't know if it was last year or the year before, I don't know when it was.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm cooking dinner, you know, busy all in the kitchen.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Everything's hot and whatnot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've got this whole gourmet meal made.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My brother's there, his family's there, you know, my husband's family's there, everybody's there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Everybody, it's time to eat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Everybody, it's time to eat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They think this football game is more interesting than my food.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I spent all day making this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So it's like, you know, just went, took the TV, thought about throwing it at my brother.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>He's 45 years old.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>He should be listening, you know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But just threw it on the ground, smashed it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Now you will listen.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I stood there, screamed for a little bit, got it all out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I felt so good to get it out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I stood there, screamed, they're all staring, but they ate.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel like you planned to throw the TV or just something came up in the moment?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It just happened.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not planning or anything, but I just want them to eat, you know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It was more of a spur of the moment thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>A spur of the moment, completely a spur of the moment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But it got their attention.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They ate.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It got their attention, the TV, it had been broken.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right, so this has, your anger and some of your behaviors caused some recent trouble with the law.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's why you're here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Everything, like I said, is blown out of proportion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There's no need for police, no need for the courts or anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's like...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But now they're involved and you feel like counseling might be helpful.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>If I want to keep my job, yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can't go to jail.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can't do that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So counseling would be helpful in that regard.</div>
