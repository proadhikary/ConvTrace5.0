                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Hi, Hazel.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>How are you doing today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Are you okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know when we met last time for your intake, you were concerned about some presentations that you had to give at school.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Do you want to talk about that today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, so in school, I am in school for teaching, and we have to give presentations a lot, as you can imagine, on different things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And so, it's something that's recurring.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And what happened was, I gave a really bad one one time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>A bad presentation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I wasn't feeling very well, and I gave, I think I was just really tired from studying all night, and I gave a really bad presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then, like now, ever since, like when I've tried to give subsequent presentations, I am just so nervous, and I'm up there like sweating, and like starting to forget what I'm going to say.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I'm just like a fear of getting up there and having to get a presentation, because I feel like I'm going to vomit.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So was there a time before, like recently, when you had to give presentations?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, I mean like before and earlier in my, like I'm towards the end of my degree, so throughout my program I have, I have a lot to do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And how did you do with those?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Pretty well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I mean, I consider myself a pretty good student, so normally I do pretty well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It seemed to come out of nowhere.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So this presentation that you gave with the, where you received a poor score, maybe just an isolated incident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, like I was saying, I wasn't, I wasn't feeling very well, I don't think, and it really hasn't happened.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But that experience has still led to a lot of anxiety with subsequent presentations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Oh yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like I'm worried about my grades suffering as a result and, you know, how well I'm going to do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So, would it be okay if we kind of step through the whole process of you giving a presentation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, sure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Is, before I start with that, is this something that leads to anxiety, like right now or other times or really just in that moment when you're presenting?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Mostly it's most intense in that moment and like maybe like leading up to it, like in preparation that I know that this is going to happen.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like I always know when I'm going to present, like it'll be like, she'll, the teacher will say, oh, well, you know, you're this Thursday, someone else's next Thursday.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the closer it gets to that event, the more anxious I am, like in anticipation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So you start feeling anxiety a few days before presentation or?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, I would say a few days mostly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>When does it start to get really distressing for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like two days before or one day before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Then I'm like, oh my gosh, like, am I ready?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like what if I mess up?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You know, what if I get a bad grade?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All these like what ifs.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So, would it be okay if we step into this process and kind of break down the steps of the presentation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So let's say that you're taking, what's one of the classes you're taking now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Early childhood.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Early childhood.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So let's say you have a presentation in that class a few days from now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just a normal presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So let's now move to two days out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Where you would start to feel a little anxiety about it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>What's going through your mind at that two day out point?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I would say like, am I prepared enough?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like did I do enough, you know, to study or to write down?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Did I do enough?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So your thought is, did I do enough preparation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Which leads to maybe I didn't is what I'm really thinking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like I'm not prepared enough as I should be.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not prepared.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not prepared enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So that's the thought you're having about 48 hours before the presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not prepared enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So kind of thinking about that thought and what happens afterward, do you have a reaction like any type of emotional affective, we call it affective reaction to that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So at that point I'm usually like more like anxious, maybe like irritable a little bit, um, mostly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And that goes substantially unchanged, that feeling for how long?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Um, like the day before it like kind of gets more intense when I'm like nitpicking like, well, I forgot this or I didn't forget this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you know, remembering what happened last time when I didn't do so well and worrying about my grade, like more thoughts pop in my head of things that I forgot or what if sort of things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So the same type of thought, just more intense.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>More intense.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And the feeling is also more intense.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yes.</div>
