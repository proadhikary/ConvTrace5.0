                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How you doing today?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm all right, thanks.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>How are you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm doing okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Thank you for asking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I understand that you've been having some difficulty with some symptoms.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me about what's been going on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, for the past maybe couple weeks, I guess, few weeks, I have these morning meetings once a week at work and I have to make a presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And every time I go to present, it's my turn and I start getting really nervous.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Start getting really nervous.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, morning meeting at work and so does each person at the meeting present in a row?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>We all take turns.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You all take turns.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And when you start to feel nervous when it's your time to talk or before or after that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, usually the kind at the start of the meeting because I know I'm going to have to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been to about 10 of us and I always seem to be one of the last few to go like six or seven kind of in line to present.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, there's around 10 people at the meeting?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And as luck would have it, you tend to be toward the end.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, can you describe what's happening, let's say, from the beginning of the meeting in terms of what you're experiencing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So, when I walk in, I'm usually okay and say good morning to everybody and then my boss calls me to order and that's usually when it starts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It kind of starts like maybe like butterflies in my stomach kind of.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And then after he makes his report and then it just starts going around the room and my heart starts to beat faster, my palms get sweaty and I just start to feel really nervous.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've realized that I might be, I kind of, I start to tune out some of the other presentations because I start to become focused on how I'm feeling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, you're focused on the physical sensation being nervous and the mental sensation and you're not really hearing what they're saying?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that what they're saying?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, go on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, you have these physical symptoms, this nervousness, what happens then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>By the time it's my turn to present, I start, I just, I'm almost like just almost shaking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I notice that my hands are a little off and so I'll keep my hands down like in my lap and just so that I don't want anybody to see them shaking like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have a paper in front of me that I just kind of read from but when I start reading, my voice is a little shaky and I kind of stutter and trip over my words and I just, I feel like I'm not making good presentations and that it's not looking good to my boss.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, in the moment when it's your turn to present, you're still feeling that same nervousness like that doesn't go away at all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you're trying to hold your body kind of still like almost like keep control.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then your voice is kind of, sounds like crackly or breaking up as you're trying to present like bullet points like on a...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like an outline.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What happens when you have read the last point?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, when I'm done, it takes a little bit for everything to calm down but then I'm consumed by the idea that my boss thinks I did a terrible job and that he's regretting putting me in this position and that I can't make good reports or that I didn't report the right stuff, the right information to him and so it doesn't really go away.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's almost like my mind just shifts on what I'm anxious about.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, the nervousness, that stronger feeling of nervousness, that goes away.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's replaced by a more general feeling of nervousness about how your boss will think of you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Because of the presentation quality.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Because as you're presenting and kind of staying still and your voice is crackling, he's picking up on that and you're aware of that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How long have you noticed these symptoms that appear in this way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, when I was an undergrad in college, I had to make some presentations from time to time and I would get nervous when I would make the presentations and I just, maybe most people are afraid of public speaking so I kind of thought that maybe that's what it was, you know, just doing a presentation in front of like 30 something people and so it didn't really bother me then.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I figured it was just normal and I always got decent grades on my presentation so it never really bothered me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I really feel like it's only been an issue in the last few weeks.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>The last few weeks is when you noticed this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You had some nervousness before presenting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You were in college but you just kind of thought of it as normal.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It didn't really impair your ability to present.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It didn't affect your grades or anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you have any other symptoms that you think may be related or even unrelated to what's going on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not sure if it has any bearing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My mom, she doesn't like to speak in public.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I know I used to talk to her about how I feel nervous about making presentations in school and she would say, oh, you can buy it on as honey and so I don't know if that means anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So whatever you have going on, you think that maybe she has that going on too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>The same set of symptoms at least.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean I've asked her, I've told her about this and she hasn't been in a situation where she's had to do this kind of presentations like in a small group like this and so I can't compare it to that but I mean she has said that she's gotten nervous before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Any feelings of sadness or anything like that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like after I make the presentation at work and then I do start feeling really sad, like I said, because then I feel like my boss isn't satisfied with my performance and that he's going to regret his decision to give me this position and so yeah, it definitely makes me sad.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel disappointed in myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you have any substance use going on, alcohol, anything else?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have a drink every now and then.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's very, very rare.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know this is something recent for you but in these meetings so far, has the nervousness ever caused you to leave the room before they came around to your turn?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've managed to control it I guess to where I can stay there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I said, I've zoned out sometimes when other people have been presenting and I feel bad about that too because I feel like they have important information to share with me and I should give them the same respect of paying attention but I become focused on what's going on inside like my heart beating and my hands and so I zone out on them sometimes but no, I push through it and I do my presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you ever worried about what they're thinking about?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You mentioned what your boss could be thinking about you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever worried about what the other workers at the table are thinking about you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, sometimes because I feel like I'm the newest member of the management team and so I feel like they're kind of like, what is up with this chick?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Why can't she get it together?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But there's been one person who's been really supportive and she's been like, hey, you did great today and great information and things like that so that kind of helps me feel better but I guess at the end of the day to me, it's really my boss's opinion that matters because he's my boss.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever felt, you mentioned you were nervous at the beginning of the meeting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever felt nervous well in advance of the meeting?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>When I'm preparing like that morning to go to work and it's one of those like, okay, I got this meeting at nine and I start to think about it like on my way into work but I don't start feeling anything until I'm actually in the room.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, so you have this nervousness, it's fairly intense, pretty much only at these meetings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's been bothering you for a few weeks.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Something new, something a little frightening for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, we'll get you set up with treatment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'll get you in to see somebody in the next few days if that works for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that'd be great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And I appreciate you spending this time with me.</div>
