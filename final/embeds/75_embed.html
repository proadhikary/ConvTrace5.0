                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I can't focus on like what I need to do because I feel like my mind is on a lot of different things and I can't focus on exactly what I should be doing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just like I'm worried about all the different aspects.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, so this excessive worrying and all this interfering of preparing, all this goes on right up until you're getting ready to present?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, and then like while I'm presenting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So let's talk about that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Let's go into the actual day of presenting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So we have this excessive worry coming in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's interfering with your ability to prepare.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's distressing for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Now it's what in class, these presentations are in class.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're in the classroom.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you, are you the only one to present during that class or does it rotate through several people?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It depends on the presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes there's like one or two other people that have to present that night depending on like how long the topic is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, well let's use the last time you present in that class as a tempo.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What was the order?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like what order did you go in there?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The one, well the one that I really messed up I think I was first, but usually like I'm like second maybe.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, so for this example let's say you're the second.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're sitting in the classroom and another student is presenting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What's going through your mind then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I am totally zoned out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I'm not even paying attention to what that person is saying because I'm so worried about how I'm going to mess it up.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, I'm starting to like be sweaty, like my hands are clammy, my heart's starting to race a little bit and I'm just totally zoned out on what they're doing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just you know worrying about what's going to happen when I get up there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, so in that moment as you're seated you're not really watching their presentation as much because you have these strong, or somewhat strong physical symptoms.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You have your heart racing a bit you said, sweaty palms, you're zoned out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever felt the need, desire to like run out of the room?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, it's funny you should say that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was a little bit hesitant to mention that but I kind of, I do, I feel like I need to find an excuse to like use the bathroom or I just need to get out of there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, so what do you feel is most pressuring you to leave the room?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like what symptom?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I would say that just like my anxiety and my heart rate are starting to increase and I feel like I just need to get out of there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What thoughts going through your mind right then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like so let's take that kind of most severe moment when you're, let's just say we're still before the presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're sitting at the desk and your heart rate's elevated and you're not focusing on what they're doing, you're zoned out, your anxiety is high.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What thought is going through your mind right then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm thinking like I'm going to bond this anyway so I might as well just you know not go through the stress of having to do it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I've already in my head I know that it's going to end badly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I've already, I've already failed?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right, so there's no sense in getting up there and maybe if I don't get up there you know, I guess it couldn't be any worse so I might as well just leave.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you embarrassed that the professor or other students will see that you were really anxious?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I don't want, I figure if I leave then people will just maybe think I was sick or whatever and it'll be a better situation if I just left than having to see me up there you know sweating and all this, these other symptoms that I have when I actually get up there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It would be better just to leave before that starts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, so better to be thought ill that you just had to leave because you're sick.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, or have them wonder what happened then to just be up in front of everybody you know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have a severe anxiety in front of everybody and then they can see.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Very embarrassing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, that would be, that would be a very undesirable outcome for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So as you're debating that thought, like if that's coming to your head and you're thinking I just need to flee.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I just got to get out here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What happens there?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So we're maybe, what maybe 15 minutes before you present?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So tell me about that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you have that thought, you want to flee.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right and I'm looking at the clock and saying you know like how much more time in this presentation before I have to go, like should I go, should I not go, what are the consequences of running out you know and kind of playing out which would be worse.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever had to run out?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Once I went to the bathroom to try to like calm myself down or talk to myself or you know like cool off my face.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I came back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you presented.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah and then I presented.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright so you, you survived one of the more stressful.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I almost felt like I was going to be ill.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was so stressed that day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That was very, very tough on you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That particular day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You did survive it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, it was just very unpleasant.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So now we're, now we're right about to where it's time to get up and present.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right, so let's say in this scenario, if you haven't fled but you had those thoughts.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're anxious and you have some physical symptoms going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You get up and it's time to present.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What's the sequence from this point on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So typically like I go to load my presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>At this point like I have my new cards or whatever in front of me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I am like shaking at this point.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I am so, I don't know if it's scared or worried or maybe a combination of everything and I'm just like sweating.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My heart is racing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I almost feel dizzy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just so stressed out about what's going to happen and then you know I'm starting to speak and then the presentations are usually like 20 minutes or so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I have to stay up there for the duration and I'm just like you know sweating and then I'm wondering like are people looking at me or people, can people see it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know am I going to forget something?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the, so the thoughts are I wonder if they can see how anxious I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I wonder if I'm going to do poorly on the presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right or they think I've been lazy and I didn't prepare or are they going to think that you know I'm dumb or I don't know you know what I'm doing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>What are they going to think about me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So they might, they might think less of you as a person.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right or like be judging me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So there's a number of concerns that kind of go into your mind in that moment.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So when does it start to turn around?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you start presenting, it's 20 minutes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You initially get up there and get your presentation up on the, like the projection monitor, something like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When does it start to turn the corner?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It depends.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes I settle down a little bit but then usually like that, I get some sort of rhythm I think and then, but then I get anxiety again until I get my grades.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Do you know what I mean?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I'm like until, cause I feel like I'm going to do poorly until that happens.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When do you receive the grades?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes like she usually doesn't give them that day, but like often like the next day or the day after.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So does that intense anxiety that you're having while you're presenting last all the way to now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, it's definitely like dissipates once I can like go sit down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, so the, so the next big drop off for symptoms would be when you're done the presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>When eyes are maybe no longer on me, they've moved on to somebody else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I figure like, okay, they forgot about me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm safe for right then.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But then there's this other worry of now we have to see what the grades are going to be.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I convince myself that I did poorly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the thought that's going through your mind is I'm going to receive a bad grade.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And that everyone saw me, you know, sweating and all these symptoms that I have, everyone is judging me.</div>
