                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, so let's, if we could, let's rank those two things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right, so one is everyone is judging me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>They saw how I was.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And the other is a poor grade.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Which one is a larger fear for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I would say maybe like judging.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, so the grade's a concern.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, but I figure I could do better on the subsequent one.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But when people have this opinion of you, I feel like that doesn't go away as quickly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, um, and what would it mean if they, they thought you were anxious during that presentation?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I worry that they would think I'm anxious because I don't know what I'm doing or I don't belong there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, I don't belong there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So if they notice you were anxiety, then they think you don't belong at that level.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, like I don't deserve to be in that program.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I don't deserve to be in that program.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>If they don't recognize those symptoms, they wouldn't think that, but if they do, that's</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>what they might think.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right, like maybe they think that's why I'm anxious or that's why I'm not doing well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, how do you feel about your abilities and status in the program you're in?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think, you know, typically I'm one of the top students in my program and I seem to get the concepts pretty well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just when I have to demonstrate those concepts or demonstrate via like a presentation or something that I'm worried that, you know, maybe I'm an imposter or something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But, so I start to question myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I think in general that, you know, I'm a pretty good student before this and I'm doing pretty well in the program.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, so you're a good student.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You recognize that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You have this one area where you don't feel like you do a great job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's presentations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But in terms of grade, you really only had one bad presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But grades aside, you're anxious and you're worried your classmates are going to pick</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>up on that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, exactly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, so if they thought you were, you used the word imposter.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So if they thought you were an imposter, let's just say that that was something they actually believed because of what's been happening.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What would that mean?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What would it mean to you if your classmates thought you were an imposter?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe I don't deserve to be there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I don't deserve to be there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, like maybe I shouldn't be in this program.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like maybe I should just drop out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, so if they believe, if they believe you're an imposter based on these physical symptoms and anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maybe that means to you anyway, maybe that means you shouldn't, you are an imposter, you shouldn't be there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What's it, what's it feel like to say that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Depressing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like I've worked really hard, you know, to get through, you know, at least halfway through my program and it really hurts to think that that would be true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>To think this whole time you've really been, you've been faking it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You don't really belong there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, I'd like to move a little bit into evaluating evidence if that's okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So in cognitive therapy we like to look at what's, you know, what we're feeling and what we're thinking and what's, what we can see, what's observable around us and, you know, that becomes evidence and then we analyze it, evaluate it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're worried at some level, you're worried that you don't deserve to be where you are right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That you're not good enough to be a student in this program.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What evidence supports that belief that you're not good enough?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Now that I'm thinking about it here, I mean, there's not a ton to support it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But in, on that day I can think of all sorts of, you know, things to tell myself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, let's go there then on that day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So maybe like, I'm not, because I'm not prepared or because I'm messing up on, on the presentation that I'm going to get a bad grade and, you know, if I can't, if I can't speak in front of people, how am I going to speak in front of kids as a teacher, you know, one day that it will translate to something else.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like if I can't get past this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So even if I survive the program somehow I might be bad at my job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
    </div>
