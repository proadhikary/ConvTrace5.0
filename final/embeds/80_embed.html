                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you have on your presentation, do you have so many bullet points you want to cover?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, like an outline sort of thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Would it help to time the deep breathing with reviewing each one of those bullet points?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I never thought about that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I don't know how many bullet points you'd have in a presentation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maybe you'd have 10 or 20?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Something like that, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Depending on how long it is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So maybe you, as you start to review a certain bullet point, as you're trying to get it into your memory and think about it, you breathe in really deeply and then as you continue on you just let out that breath really slowly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like a rhythm sort of.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, I could do that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then you go to the next bullet point and do the same thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Never thought about it that way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm just thinking it'd be some way to structure so you would get in so many breaths.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I wouldn't forget, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, something that kind of becomes a habit.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Just make sure you keep your bullet points at a length that would work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Not a few paragraphs.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But just a few seconds each so you can get a good deep breath.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Or you could, if you did have a longer bullet point, you could have obviously several breaths.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But just some rhythm that you could kind of grab onto something concrete.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Because I know that in that moment things are probably, like you mentioned, zoning out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It becomes very easy to lose your anchors.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, exactly.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And just get really foggy, almost dizzy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, so if you can remember, you know, for a particular bullet point that you want to take three deep breaths, that might be something you can really grab onto.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And would kind of cut through that fogginess of something you could still do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When's the next presentation in that class that's coming up?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The next one I believe is next Friday.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that the next presentation you have in all the classes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And that's next Friday.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you know where you are in the order, like for presenting?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I'm actually third in this one.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So not first.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Not first.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And this one's how many minutes?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like 15 or so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's a little shorter than 20 minutes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So 15 minutes, so you have about a half hour, maybe a little more if there's time to switch out of kind of sitting there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And potential time where you could be anxious.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But also potential time when you could be reviewing, denotes your bullet points, and breathing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And saying to yourself that kind of self-talk that they're not really paying attention to me anyway.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Because that might help reduce that anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What's one thing you could say to yourself when you're up there?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I could say that in general I do pretty well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>One bad grade I think going to make me doesn't mean that I don't deserve to be here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the self-talk up there could be I deserve to be here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe I've prepared enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know that I know that I've prepared and I'm a good student.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I've prepared enough.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm a good student.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I do deserve to be here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is that something it would be helpful to write down and have as part of your notes that you can...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I think it would actually.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You can recite that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Internally as you...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Because it's not long, I think I could.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It would be easy to remember and I could just like maybe put it down on one of my note cards in front of me or something.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And how much do you believe that those statements are true?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think, you know, sitting here now I believe them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>In the moment sometimes it's a little hard to believe because I convince myself otherwise.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I think I actually believe that that's true, that I do deserve to be in the program.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Those self-talk items, you believe them to be true.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But you recognize in the moment, and I want you to be aware of this, you might not believe them as much.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But remember that, you know, we worked on them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You came up with them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you believe them now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So try to keep that in your mind as you start to doubt yourself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you're ready to recite them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's easy, I realize it's easy to form these plans.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But in the chaos of the anxiety and the worry it's harder.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the more tasks you can make concrete and that you can write down and you can rehearse, I think the better off you'll be.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I would like to see you, your presentations next Friday.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I would like to see you right before that, so it will be about a week before that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you have any questions?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>These are items you can rehearse still, even without the presentation, the self-talk and</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>the breathing and of course preparing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But do you have any questions between now and then, do you think?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't think so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think it makes sense.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you understand kind of the plan to Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>attack that anxiety symptom?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think what you kind of suggested before, like maybe practicing my deep breathing, like maybe now, like when I'm calm and getting into a habit of deep breathing, like I'm more apt to also remember it then.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you have some kind of behavioral pieces.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Right.</div>
