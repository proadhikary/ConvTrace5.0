                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I understand you've been having some difficulty with some symptoms lately.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Tell me about that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I've been having a lot of anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Just been stressed out lately.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Irritable.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You name it, I have it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The thing that's been troubling me the most though are these memories that don't seem to go away.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No matter what I do, I just keep remembering this event and it's really taken a toll on me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're having anxiety and a lot of other symptoms and you're having intrusive memories.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me about the event?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I was in a car accident a couple months ago and it was a pretty bad accident but I was okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was injured.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My car was messed up really bad.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The driver of the other car, I think they were injured pretty bad, more severe than I was.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I just can't seem to get that accident out of my mind.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does it keep replaying that accident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, over and over.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me about how you're experiencing that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I could be just in the kitchen making a pot of coffee and all of a sudden I'm back there in the accident.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm back in the car with the airbags deployed and sirens coming from a distance.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I try to shake that feeling and I just can't.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And that just overwhelms me so much that I can't do anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just have to go and sit down and I'm stuck in the house just scared to do anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So these times when you're reliving the accident, does something trigger that or does that happen just on its own?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes things trigger it and sometimes they just come out of nowhere.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I could be watching a movie and there's a bad car accident and I start thinking about it or I could be just doing nothing and the memories, they just come back full force.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this has been clearly causing you distress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>A lot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Has it been interfering at all with relationships?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, yes, I would say.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I haven't been able to go out with my friends.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just don't want to do anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My friends are always trying to get me to go out and get things off of my mind and I just don't have a desire to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't really want to be around anyone.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you find that your mood is irritable or any anger at first?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>All the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That happens frequently?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I'm on edge a lot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel like your behavior has become reckless, like taking more chances?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Somewhat.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Somewhat?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about your memory of the accident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Is it constant or does your memory change, like you lose some of that memory?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, there are times when, where it's as clear as a bell and then other times people ask me details about the accident and I can't remember a thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You can't remember any of it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>No?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So the memory kind of comes and goes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It does, yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Who do you hold responsible for the accident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, everybody tells me that I shouldn't but I hold myself responsible for it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I try to go in a different way, home from work one day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It was a way that I've never gone before and, you know, somebody cut me off and I slammed into them but if I didn't go that way, I would have never gotten into the car accident.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Did the other driver get a ticket from the accident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think he did.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think he got a ticket for reckless driving or failure to yield or something but, I mean,</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>if I wasn't on that road, then neither of us would have been in the accident.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you still blame yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about your emotional state?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Since these symptoms have started, has it been mostly unhappy or down, neutral, anytime when you're happy?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, nothing seems to make me happy anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just always depressed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Your mood's always down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about with driving?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like, so have you been avoiding driving or have you driven since the accident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have but I don't if I don't have to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like, I definitely avoid going places like if I'm making dinner and I'm missing an ingredient, then I'll just go without it before driving to the market.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just I don't want to be behind the wheel of a car.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're avoiding it but you have driven.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Tell me about the experience when you go to drive.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Oh, boy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I have to almost prepare myself hours in advance because it's so hard for me to get out the house.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>In terms of anxiety or what's going on?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just having like knots in my stomach and, you know, shortness of breath.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My chest is pounding.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just fearful.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Just it's a lot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's very overwhelming.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's very stressful.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It is.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you find that when you are driving that you are more aware of what other cars are doing and what you're doing in your car?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, probably more so now than ever.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just always looking out, making sure that I don't cause another car accident.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm driving slower.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm, you know, I'm waiting longer to switch lanes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just, yeah, definitely.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're more aware of your surroundings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Definitely.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So when something surprises us, there's a natural response or startled.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>This is called a startled response.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And everybody has that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you noticed that that's changed for you since these symptoms have started?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How's it changed?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Everything startles me anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The doorbell ringing, the phone ringing, just, you know, somebody getting up to move their chair.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Any little sound that just has me like looking over my shoulder to see what's going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you find yourself jumping?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, a lot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about your ability to concentrate?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Has that changed at all?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It has.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It decreased a lot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I haven't really been able to concentrate on anything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have things all over my house where I've started things and moved on to something else because I can't concentrate on one thing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about sleeping?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How are you doing with sleep?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Not too good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not getting a lot of sleep at all these days.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm up all hours of the night sometimes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just wake up for no reason.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes I'll wake up out of a dream just scared.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm just... I'm not sleeping well at all.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So a lot of challenges with sleep.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you use any drugs or alcohol?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>No?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about medical problems?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Never.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are there times from when these symptoms started when you feel kind of separated from your own body?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like it's like an unreal experience?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've had a couple experiences like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me about those?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, there was one time I was at work and we were sitting in the cafeteria and just all of a sudden everything seemed to start going in slow motion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I could hear people talking but it sounded very slow.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It was like, it's hard to describe but I could see everything but it just wasn't moving at a normal pace.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I kind of felt like I was watching a movie almost.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And that's happened at least two or three times.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I didn't really understand what was going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>A friend of mine told me, she said that I was kind of like spaced out and she was like snapping her fingers in front of my face and I could see her but I couldn't really hear what was going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And then I just like snapped out of it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And everybody was sitting around staring at me and they were talking about what was going on and I had no idea what was happening.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But it was very embarrassing.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They were watching me like I was a movie.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>This has happened a few times?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, in a couple different locations.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>One time I was at work, one time I was at school and these things just happened out of the blue.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about a time when you felt like the world became unreal?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're not detached from your body but the world becomes unreal or dreamlike or distorted.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever had that happen?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>No?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's more being separated from your body, more that feeling?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you mentioned the time slowing down?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, very, like slow motion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Slow motion?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, like you were watching a movie in slow motion.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The sound and everything was just dragging.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Jessica, I'm going to get you in to see a counselor here if you're okay with that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, I think that would be okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I appreciate you taking the time to explain these symptoms.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I know they're distressing for you and for taking the time to answer my questions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's been helpful for me to help figure out what's going on and help manage your care.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I appreciate your help.</div>
