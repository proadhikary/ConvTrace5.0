                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Asking children and teens about potential traumas they may have experienced can be challenging, particularly for clinicians who don't have a focus in mental health.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But we know that these adverse childhood experiences are prevalent and significantly impact lifelong health.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it's essential that all pediatric healthcare providers feel comfortable and competent to do a routine screen for these adverse childhood experiences.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>In the previous video we saw demonstrated how a clinician can use the ACE screening questionnaire to interview a parent and determine a child's ACE score.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Dr. Lawson met with 10-year-old Sam and his mom Dana and did a routine physical checkup on Sam and had no concerns for him.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>She was about to finish the interview when Sam's mother raised that he was having difficulties at school and she also noted that there were some stresses at home.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Dr. Lawson interviewed Dana first on her own and gave Sam an ACE score of 3 based on what his mother was reporting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>She now meets with Sam on his own to ask him the same screening questions and confirm his score.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Hi Sam, thanks for waiting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I talked to your mom a little bit about some of the things that were going on at home and school.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And now I'm going to spend a few minutes with you asking you some questions, the questions I ask all the kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Some of them are going to kind of fit for you and some of them might not fit so well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But if there's things that you're curious about I'm asking or if you have questions as we're talking then feel free to ask me about why I'm asking something or ask any questions, okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>The first thing I wanted to check in about was how have things been going at home?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Oh, okay, I guess.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay, you guess?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it sounds like there's a lot of things that have happened, lots of stressors and lots of things that have happened.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How's your mom doing with all of that stuff?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Okay, I guess she's fine.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>She's fine?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have there ever been a time where you feel like your mom isn't able to get out of bed or do the things that she needs to do?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So she's getting out of bed and she's looking after you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Most of the time, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Most of the time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What does most of the time mean?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, she's mostly doing a lot of, well she's doing a lot of stuff so she's doing things pretty good, I guess.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What are some of the things that you might think she might do a bit better?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Oh, maybe getting some dinner, maybe?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Because sometimes I just have to get both Cheerios.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So sometimes you're not having dinner?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How many times a week would you say that that's happening, that you're having Cheerios for dinner?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Pretty much every day.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What do you think are some of those stressful things?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, probably because my grandma's fighting with her a lot and also my dad moving away because they were divorced a year ago.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Your mom told me that your dad and your mom aren't together anymore and that he's moved out to DC.</div>

                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>A year ago.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And is there a plan for you to see him?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What I've heard is that there's some stressors and some things that are hard for you in your life and you talk to me about the arguing that's happening between your mom and your grandma.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That your dad has moved away.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That you're not always in the right clothes and you have to fix some of your meals.</div>

                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But you've also told me that nobody's hurting you in a physical or in a verbal or sexual way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Nobody's saying mean things to you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That you're not worried about your mom emotionally and that she's not worried about her all the time, struggling more emotionally.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And that nobody you know is in prison or has been in prison.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you don't have any concerns about drugs or drinking or in your home.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Sam, do you think some of those stressors are what's making it hard for you at school?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Probably, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Why do you think that might be?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe because I'm thinking about that and then I'm not thinking about what I'm doing at the moment and then I don't get very much.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't get a lot done.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, Sam.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That when things are stressful at home that kids have trouble concentrating and it affects them at school.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I'm going to talk to your mom more and we're going to try and figure out a way that I can help you and your mom with some of that stuff.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So thanks for coming in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Dr. Lawson's interview with Sam confirms that his ACE score is 3 as he endorses loss of a parent due to divorce, physical neglect and also a sense of emotional deprivation.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So we know that Sam is at elevated risk for a host of physical and mental illnesses beginning in adolescence that could persist throughout his life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But Dr. Lawson's now in a position to meet again with Sam and his mother and collaboratively develop a focused and evidence-based intervention plan that should help change Sam's lifetime health trajectory.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Clinicians can visit the online trauma toolkit website for a list of resources on these evidence-based interventions which have been shown to be helpful for children like Sam and their families.</div>
