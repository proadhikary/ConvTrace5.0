                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>It's so nice to meet you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Hi, I'm Judy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How are you doing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm pretty good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well welcome, sit down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever been to a counseling session before?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, this will be my first time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well okay then, so just a little bit about us.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We're a counseling center and we work with people with a range of different things going on with them.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And between the two of us we can work through whatever is going on with you in your life.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But before we begin, I just wanted to let you know that everything you say here is confidential.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Unless you're intending to harm yourself or other people and then we're obligated to report it for their own safety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does that make sense?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that makes sense too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I also just want to forewarn you, today is going to be a lot of questions.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Just trying to get some background of where you're at and where you want to go.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Also, would it be okay with you if I write down some things as we talk?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that's totally fine.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So to begin, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, like I said, my name is Judy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm 42.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have two kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Max, who's eight years old, and Chelsea, who is six.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Max plays soccer.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>He's very active around the home.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like almost too active.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And Chelsea is a little know-all, but keeps me in line.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And kids are both very active, pretty good in school, get along pretty well, and they're good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>They're good kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sweet kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm so glad.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I'd love to hear what's been going on from your perspective and why you're excited to come here today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I have a lot of negative stuff going on in my life right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been very stressed lately because I lost my job pretty recently.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It was a rough time and I haven't been handling it very well according to my husband.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And he told me that I had to come to counseling where he would leave me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So that's why I'm here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm definitely glad that you came.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When did you notice this change in yourself or notice that this was a problem?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I lost my job about a month ago.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I got laid off a month ago.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it seems like losing your job has really affected your relationship with your husband and family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You said you have two other kids, that you love with them, right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yes, I have two kids Max and Chelsea.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I love them a lot and we live all together, the four of us.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The children are wonderful, but I feel like I haven't been a great mom recently to them or my husband.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's unfair to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So that leads great into my next question.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What's your relationship with your husband like?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, we've had our ups and downs like every marriage.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I spend a lot of time with the kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>He works a lot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>He's not very close with the kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I'm not as close with my parents.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm very close with my mom.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And she's been there for me a lot in the past.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Interesting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And how long have you been married for?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Just seven years.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And what do you like to do in your free time with your family?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you spend time with them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I go to the gym a lot.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's more of an individual activity for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's something that releases a lot of my stress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And that's kind of how I, I don't know, it's part of who I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But with the kids, I like them and I drive them all over the place all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I like to practice, I like to practice everything.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So there's not a lot of time for me to really have time with my kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I don't know, I like to, you know, we read together every night.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I try to make time for the kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I take them to the beach when it's warm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You know, there's a lot of things that we do together.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Good, good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you find you can draw support from your family?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You mentioned your aunt, but...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I don't really want to warn the kids because they think they're so young.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I think they know that something's up, but I don't really know to what extent they know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I am closer to my aunt.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>She's always been there for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But my husband and I have had a rough patch recently since I lost my job.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, when you're stressed, you sometimes go to your aunt, but do you turn to people for comfort?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Or do you have an activity that helps you calm down or another method that helps you cope?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like I said, I have been going to the gym a lot, but I haven't been doing that as much recently.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Maybe, I'm not really sure why I haven't made time for it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I haven't really felt like myself recently.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But a lot of times, I turn to other things more than people.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What kind of things do you mean?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like substances, drugs and alcohol?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I've never used them before, but I feel like it helps me relax, calm down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And a lot of times, it's something that I feel like I need to be, I guess, relaxed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you find that's affecting your family?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Your relationships with them or the way you interact?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It didn't for a while.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But like I said, about a month ago was a turning point.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And when I lost my job, I do feel very ashamed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I made a horrible mistake the other day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can't believe I'm saying this, but I drove with them in the car after I had a few drinks and they got pulled over.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I felt like I endangered my family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I felt like I was being a bad mom and that was a really big life to me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That must have been pretty scary for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>But if you think of it this way, it could be a turning point.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you now notice what you're doing wrong and how you can improve it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So it's progress that you're admitting that and that you do need to improve on certain things.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you take any other medications?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What medications?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Oxycodone.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And why do you have a prescription for that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I had surgery a few years back and I got fulfilled.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I didn't really finish all the pills, but I've been taking them recently when I feel like I need to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And how often do you take them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've taken three over the course of a month, but I know that I shouldn't be.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How do you feel when you take them?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's numbing and it allows me to relax and escape from the issues in the home and workplace.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess not really a workplace anymore, but I know that I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing and I know that it's wrong.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I guess that's why I'm here.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How has your family ever had a history of drug abuse problems and drinking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My dad, I think, was an alcoholic for a while, not really diagnosed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I grew up with a lot of that in the home.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>A lot of just genuine parents didn't mesh too well or a lot of infighting in the home.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And the older I get, the more that I think that it might have been alcohol related on my father's part.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My mother definitely not.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My father though, and I believe that his father had a problem similar to that as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And is it the first time you found yourself turning to it?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>A few times in college I found myself depressed, confused about growing up, getting a career.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I wasn't an addict in college, but I would do things with the intention of feeling better and forgetting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think that's kind of something that's been beneath the surface for a while.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>When I find myself stressful, I can sink back into that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever experienced any form of sexual assault or abuse that maybe made you turn to alcohol?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you having trouble eating or sleeping?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Eating, yeah, not as much or as healthy as I have before, but sleeping absolutely because of stress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I find myself not sleeping as well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah, that definitely happens with stress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And what's a typical day like for you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, lately my husband's been taking care of the kids more because of last week and the incident with getting pulled over.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>He doesn't trust me with the kids, which I guess they understand.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>He doesn't trust me to drive kids places because of last week, so he usually will take them to school and I'll make him late for work and that makes him upset.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And there's an argument there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>When I wake up, I'll have a drink, so I'm not too hung up from the night before.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Then I watch my show, I get the mail, and usually there's a bill, so I have a few more drinks.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And then I try to start dinner, but it's usually hard because I'm pretty intoxicated, but I start dinner and usually at the night is the letter of a shit show and the kids are frustrated and you figure it out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And are you feeling sad or down in addition to being stressed?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm pretty sad.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And when you're sad, do you turn to your faith?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you been praying a lot?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Some I used to, but I don't as much anymore.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's hard to believe that somebody's watching over me with all this negative stuff.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does other things give you hope besides your faith?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>The kids.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Watching them play together and be together really gives me a lot of hope.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I love seeing them do what they love to do and I love it when I know that what I do can enable them to enjoy their activities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But it's been hard to do that recently because I drive them to school, I've been taking them to activities because my husband's been doing this for me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So it's getting kind of empty-fills with them getting into the family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Thank you for sharing that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So we can start to meet on a regular basis and try to work through all these things together.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>From what I've collected, from what you kind of just told me, you're really stressed about losing your job and so you want to find different ways to cope with your stress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then also try to rebuild the trust in your family, with your husband, your kids that they may have lost during the driving incident last week.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sounds a lot like what I want to do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I hope that you're able to help me with that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So in order for this to be most effective, let's brainstorm some small steps we can work on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Maybe make a list together and it can be very small unless it's not too overwhelming at first.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So for instance, to work on the drinking thing, we can start by cutting down the number of drinks slowly today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And it can be really hard to just stop cold turkey because you can get withdrawal symptoms or it may make you even more stressed out.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So I want you to be able to be confident in the goal you're setting and in yourself.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So can you do one last drink each day or something like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So what would you like to achieve from our work together in the future, by the end?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I hear what you're saying.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I understand.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I don't want to stop moving completely.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But it sounds like a very logical solution at this point.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It doesn't sound like something I'd be able to do at this point immediately.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>We can maybe get there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not really sure if we can completely get there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And then after that, I'd really like to fix my relationship with my family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So if I go to my husband, we can patch things with my parents too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So let's start with a goal regarding drinking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What do you think is a reasonable thing for yourself?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can start having four drinks a day, maybe four maybe.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's good.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's a good one.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Then in a few days you can try having three, and two, and one, until you don't need to turn to alcohol for comfort, and so on and so forth.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>If you need a different way to find comfort, you can try stress relieving activities.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So what would be a good activity for you to do?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I think I could try journaling, maybe drawing or painting.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I did a lot of art in college.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'd really like to get back into that and I would just call it a day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's a really great idea.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Then in the future, what are you thinking regarding your career?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't think anyone's going to want somebody as dressed up as me right now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>What was your old job again?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was a staff captain.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Well, you don't need to jump right back into work again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That can be a way in the future, or maybe a month or two.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>If you think about it in the future, what would be your goal?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I guess I'd like to get back in the game, but I think more important for me is that I patch things up with my family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But I do need to try making money again to support the family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's not logical for me to assume that I can go a long time without it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>That's why I want to fix my issues, get back in the job, and see what I can do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What kind of things do you think could help rebuild the trust within your family?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I could block out some time each week to really spend a long time with each of my family members, my kids and my husband.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Kids I don't think really understand what's going on, so I don't have to work as hard with them, but I would still love to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just really do need to work in relationship with my husband, go back to what things we used to do together, and see what we can do to get back there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>A way you could do that is try family therapy or couples counseling.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Would you be interested in something like that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that's definitely something we could do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, I'm very happy that you came to talk to me today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>From what I heard, it sounds like losing your job has been incredibly stressful for you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you turned to substance abuse to try and relieve some of that stress.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel a little bit better after talking to me?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I absolutely do.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I feel like the weight has really been lifted off my shoulders, and the fact that somebody is going to be in charge of my recovery, I think is huge.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>We'll definitely be working hand in hand, so you're in charge of your recovery, but I'm definitely here to help you along the way.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I really am looking forward to our next session together.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Me too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, until our next session, I want you to try and journal every time that you're feeling upset or like you need to drink, stress, and then bring your journal and we can go through and find the times you felt like you needed substance to help you.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And in addition to that, maybe try and cut back on your drinking, maybe one less glass or something of wine or anything for now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And then next time, let me know how that goes.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I can totally make sure of that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So, I want you to know that I really do believe in you and that you can get through this.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And if you continue to come to our sessions, we really can work together to accomplish these goals that we just discussed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thanks.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I hope so too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Great.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have a good day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Thank you.</div>
