                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I understand you've been having some recent difficulties that brought you into our agency.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Can you tell me about that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I've been having a lot of anxiety lately.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Anxiety?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Just getting really nervous in the morning when it's time to go to work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Just like butterflies in my stomach kind of pounding hard.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're anxious when you're getting ready to go to work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you know what might be causing that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, I noticed it a little while ago when I went to get in my car to go to work in the morning.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was putting some stuff in the trunk and I saw some damage that had happened to the car from a previous car accident.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And just out of nowhere I started feeling nervous about driving to work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you went out to your car, you saw some damage, it reminded you of an accident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was in an accident at the end of last year.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I didn't get hurt.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There was no real damage to the car that I noticed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just went on about my business.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I didn't have any issues after the accident.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And now all of a sudden I'm thinking about this car accident again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I don't know where that's coming from.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you said the accident occurred at the end of last year?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can't really remember exactly when, but it was cold out when it happened.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So maybe about eight months ago.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Does that sound right?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, around Halloween or so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When did the symptoms start, being anxious when you're getting ready to go to work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I would say at least a month ago, maybe six weeks.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you've been having those continuously from then?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Every morning I get up, I'm just really nervous about going to work.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I come out to get in the car and sometimes I can barely get in, just thinking about being in a car accident again.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you ever been late to work because of the anxiety?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm late almost every day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Almost every day?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So this has been a problem for you in a few different ways.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I even called out a couple times because I was just paralyzed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you tried anything to reduce the anxiety, like using another car or anything else?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I live in a house with multiple cars, so I tried driving my mom's car to work one day.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I had the same feelings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And initially I thought it was just my car because I did notice some damage to the back of the car.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was hit in the back.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And I was going through the trunk one day and I saw that the car was actually pushed in.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I didn't think there was any real damage.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Then I noticed damage to the back of the car and I was like, wow, I could have been seriously hurt in this accident.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>And that's when I started having these feelings.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I just started thinking about how bad the accident could have been.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So you ask if I tried to do anything different.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I tried driving my mom's car.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I tried driving my dad's car.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But it seems to be just driving any car.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm having all of this anxiety.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you're having kind of physical distress too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like you're feeling it physically?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Overwhelmed.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm feeling a lot of swelling in my chest.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Like really panicky.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you ever have any dreams about the accident or anything related to the accident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, not really.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you ever have any point when you're not asleep where you feel like you're kind of taken back to the time the accident happened?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like you're reliving it in any way?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Nothing like that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you remember the accident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I remember it pretty well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was waiting at a stop sign and I think the person behind me, they must not have been paying attention, but they rear-ended me.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Who do you believe is responsible for the accident?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Nobody really.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, it was an accident.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>There was no real damage.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Accidents happen all the time.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's just a fender bender.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So from the time that you noticed these anxiety symptoms, have you had periods where you were happy and had kind of positive emotional experiences?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I've been really down since I started having these symptoms.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you been down the whole time?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have there been moments where you haven't been or has it been consistently down?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I would say more down.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>More down, but sometimes up?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I can't really remember any times.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Not sure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about your relationships with other people?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have they changed from when the anxiety started?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, not really.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel detached from people?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Detached?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>You mean like separated, like not wanting to be around?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Not connecting with people?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, not really.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Nothing like that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about any feelings of irritability or anger outbursts or anything like that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Nothing?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you feel like you've been behaving in a more reckless way at all?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>What do you mean by reckless?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like taking more chances in relationships or another, nothing like that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You're aware of like when something surprises us, we kind of have this startle response, like we jump, it's natural.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you noticed that response has changed at all?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I have been a little on edge.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Things have been like scaring me, the phone ringing, people knocking at the door, dogs barking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's kind of had me on edge a little bit.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And you feel like your response is more than it used to be, more than just the natural startle response you had?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, that's kind of worrying me a little bit too.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>That's worrying you?</div>
