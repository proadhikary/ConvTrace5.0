                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Eh, how are you?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I'm okay, thanks for asking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>I see that you have signed a release so I could talk to your mother and that she brought you in today.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>What's going on there?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, you know, they think I have a drinking problem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Your family thinks you have a drinking problem?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, so what really started this was this past weekend, um, they came to pick me up for my cousin's bridal shower and, uh, I was drunk when they came to get me so I couldn't go and now everybody's pretty pissed at me so here I am.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So they asked you to come into the agency?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, you know, I don't want them to all hate me or anything so I agreed to come.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you believe that you have a drinking problem?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean I like to drink.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't, you know, I think it's okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>You think it's okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I like it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I like drinking.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Come on, do you mind if I ask you a few questions today to your drinking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Oh, that's fine.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So how often do you drink now?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, pretty much every day I would think.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I drink every day on the weekends for sure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, but like, uh, during the week I'll go to the, whatever the best local happy hour is, you know, I'll just go about what's going on.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So I'll go after work and have some drinks.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about on the weekend?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>On the weekend I kind of keep to myself, you know, um, so I'll drink a little for whatever I have at the house.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>But yeah, I don't really go out a lot on the weekend, mostly to stay at home and, you know, drink whatever I have there.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And how much are you drinking, let's say on the weekend?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, it's hard to keep track I think.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'd say a couple cases over maybe like two or three cases of beer throughout the weekend.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>If there's something on sale, you know, at the liquor store down the street, I'll get like a bottle of vodka or something to go along with it.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, how about during the week?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, during the week I just stay at the bar for a few hours, maybe have like six or seven drinks, and then go home.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I'll have a glass of wine when I get home.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you drinking more than you want to?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, I guess so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I've kind of tried to make a plan to just stay on the weekends to drink some, and that hasn't really kept up because I like to go to the happy hours and stuff.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you've tried to cut down before and...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I have, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>...are not able to.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, it's not really happening though.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I don't really see it happening.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you have cravings for alcohol?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, yeah, you could say so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well, yeah, when I'm at work I want to drink, and when I'm out doing stuff I want to drink.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you using exclusively alcohol, or are there other drugs involved?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, right now just alcohol is legal.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was inpatient a couple times for cocaine, but I've stopped that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>It's not really something I want to do anymore, so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When was the last time you were inpatient?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, about four months ago, five months ago.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Four or five months ago?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And at that time you used cocaine?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I was using coke and alcohol.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And alcohol?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>And why did you stop using cocaine?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, well, I graduated from college.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I was kind of a partier in college, and then I had to get a job, and it's kind of, I had a fear of losing my job because of the cocaine, and I had to get a drug test and stuff, so that's kind of in the back of my mind with that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>So, yeah, I think the treatment helped with that.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you crave cocaine?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, no, mostly just alcohol.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Just alcohol?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Mm-hmm.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about your work?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Are you having any trouble keeping your job or your performance at your job been okay?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, I think I'm not doing tip-top of what I could be doing, but, you know, it hasn't really been a problem.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I haven't been threatened to be fired or anything like that, but, you know, I'll come and leave every once in a while, but I sneak in, so nobody knows.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>All right.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Any social problems because of the alcohol use?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, me with my family kind of right now, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'm not really getting along with them very well.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um, my friends, though, when I go out with them during the week, we get along fine, but, you know, they're just not really as fun as they used to be, so sometimes...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Your friends?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Sometimes they want to do stuff and go to the movies or whatever, and they get a little mad because I don't want to go.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'd rather go, you know, party somewhere.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So you're having some social problems.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Not so much with your friends a little bit, but more with your family.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>More with my family, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I guess my friends aren't that happy with me, but I don't think it's a huge deal.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>My best friend, I haven't talked to in a couple days because she, uh, she was mad at me for not coming to dinner with her the other night because I would rather frank, and she didn't want to do that, so...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So there have been some problems with the...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I guess so.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>With the friends?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Have you found that, uh, you're engaging in any activities that are physically dangerous because of alcohol?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um... I've gotten hurt a couple times.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I've fallen down the steps, but I'm not going, like, skydiving or anything, you know, so...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I mean, I did sprain my ankle a couple months ago because I fell down the steps, but other than that, I've been okay.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you find that, um, you have any exacerbation of symptoms that you have already, like any medical or mental health problems made worse by the alcohol?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>No, I would say I'm pretty healthy.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Yeah?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>So... did you notice a point after you started drinking when you had to increase the amount that you drank to get the same effect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Oh, yeah.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When did that happen?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Um... I think I kind of go through phases with it, you know.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'll drink a certain amount for a little while, then I'll notice, you know, I'm not even drunk anymore, so... I'll have to drink some more.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When was the last time you noticed that?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>When you noticed you had to drink a lot more to get the same effect?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I'd say, like, last weekend, you know, I was, uh, drinking a couple beers at my house and a few hours had passed and I drank probably, like, 10, 12 beers and I wasn't feeling anything, so...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>I started drinking a little faster and then I started, you know, feeling a little better.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>How about withdrawal?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Do you have any symptoms of withdrawal when you stop drinking?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Uh...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Like physical symptoms, anxiety?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Well... I mean, I want some more, for sure.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Craving?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, I crave some more, but I have a headache now.</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Headache?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Yeah, so...</div>
                
                <div class="bubble therapist"><b>Therapist</b><br>Alright, Jackie, are you open to seeing a counselor here at the agency?</div>
                
                <div class="bubble patient"><b>Patient</b><br>Uh... I think that's what my mom really wants, so...</div>
